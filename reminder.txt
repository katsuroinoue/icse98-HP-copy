               *******************************************
		WELCOME TO KYOTO IN CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON
			CITY OF HISTORY AND LEARNING
               *******************************************
Kyoto, a city with 1,200 years of history, is the cultural soul of
Japan. Nestled among low mountains, it is blessed with both natural
beauty and a rich historical legacy. It is the ideal site for
international conventions. From its establishment as Japan's capital
in 794 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Kyoto flourished as the
center of government, commerce and culture in Japan. Traditional arts
and an abundance of shrines and temples give the city its distinct
character. With nearly 1.5 million residents, Kyoto is a vibrant
mixture of old and new. Many high-tech firms have chosen it as their
headquarters, and the city boasts 47 public and private colleges and
universities. These significant intellectual resources combine with
Kyoto's long history and tradition to provide an ideal milieu for
innovation and creativity.
			NATURAL BEAUTY 
Kyoto is a panorama of the changing seasons: from the springtime
cherry blossoms lining narrow walkways, the lush greenery of summer,
to the brilliant autumn foliage of Japanese maples and the delicate
layer of snow covering the surrounding mountainsides in winter. The
passage of seasons is also evident in the beautiful gardens of Kyoto's
ancient temples and shrines.
			CULTURAL HERITAGE 
Reflecting its long history as the cultural and religious center of
Japan, Kyoto is home to nearly 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto
shrines. The city's international cultural significance was recognized
when 17 historical sites in Kyoto were designated as UNESCO World
Cultural Heritage Sites. Kyoto is the location of 20% of Japan's
national treasures. More than 60 museums throughout the city offer
visitors the opportunity to view priceless works of art and important
cultural objects.
			KYOTO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HALL 
Japan's leading convention center, the Kyoto International Conference
Hall, is a complex consisting of seven separate conference halls, the
largest of which can hold 2,000 persons. Another 70 conference rooms
of various sizes are available for smaller meetings. Two large banquet
halls and a Japanese landscape garden offer additional settings for
convention participants to meet and communicate informally.
			TRANSPORT 
Kyoto has many modern hotels with accommodations for up to 20,000
visitors. Located near the center of Japan, it is readily accessible
by land and air. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet train) links Tokyo
with Kyoto in 2 hours and 15 minutes. Overseas visitors arriving at
Kansai International Airport (KIX) have a comfortable 75-minute ride
by the JR Haruka Express train to Kyoto Station. There is a direct
subway link from Kyoto Station to Kyoto International Conference Hall,
taking about 20 minutes.
