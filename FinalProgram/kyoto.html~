CITY OF HISTORY AND LEARNING</H2>
Kyoto, a city with 1,200 years of history, is the cultural soul of Japan.
Nestled among low mountains, it is blessed with both natural beauty and
a rich historical legacy. It is the ideal site for international conventions.
From its establishment as Japan's capital in 794 until the Meiji Restoration
in 1868, Kyoto flourished as the center of government, commerce and culture
in Japan. Traditional arts and an abundance of shrines and temples give
the city its distinct character. With nearly 1.5 million residents, Kyoto
is a vibrant mixture of old and new. Many high-tech firms have chosen it
as their headquarters, and the city boasts 47 public and private colleges
and universities. These significant intellectual resources combine with
Kyoto's long history and tradition to provide an ideal milieu for innovation
and creativity.
<H2>
NATURAL BEAUTY</H2>
Kyoto is a panorama of the changing seasons: from the springtime cherry
blossoms lining narrow walkways, the lush greenery of summer, to the brilliant
autumn foliage of Japanese maples and the delicate layer of snow covering
the surrounding mountainsides in winter. The passage of seasons is also
evident in the beautiful gardens of Kyoto's ancient temples and shrines.
<H2>
CULTURAL HERITAGE</H2>
Reflecting its long history as the cultural and religious center of Japan,
Kyoto is home to nearly 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. The
city's international cultural significance was recognized when 17 historical
sites in Kyoto were designated as UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.
Kyoto is the location of 20% of Japan's national treasures. More than 60
museums throughout the city offer visitors the opportunity to view priceless
works of art and important cultural objects.
<H2>
KYOTO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HALL</H2>
Japan's leading convention center, the <A HREF="http://www.joho-kyoto.or.jp/KICH/index_e.html">Kyoto
International Conference Hall</A>, is a complex consisting of seven separate
conference halls, the largest of which can hold 2,000 persons. Another
70 conference rooms of various sizes are available for smaller meetings.
Two large banquet halls and a Japanese landscape garden offer additional
settings for convention participants to meet and communicate informally.

TRANSPORT</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Kyoto has many modern hotels with accommodations
for up to 20,000 visitors. Located near the center of Japan, it is readily
accessible by land and air. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet train) links
Tokyo with Kyoto in 2 hours and 15 minutes. Overseas visitors arriving
at <A HREF="http://ks.kiis.or.jp/~kixinfo/">Kansai International Airport
(KIX)</A> have a comfortable 75-minute ride by the <A HREF="http://www.westjr.co.jp/index_e.html">JR
Haruka Express train</A> to Kyoto Station. There is a direct subway link
from Kyoto Station to Kyoto International Conference Hall, taking about
20 minutes.</TD>

<H2> How to Reach Kyoto International Conference Hall and Prince Hotel
from Kansai International Airport KIX </H2></A>
<p>

There are several ways to get to the conference site, but we show a
typical one here.
<p>

Limited express train "Haruka" served by JR goes directly from KIX
station to Kyoto station.
<p>

You'll arrive at the international arrival of the first floor of KIX
building. There is an overbridge from the second floor of the airport
building to the airport station, so you'll use elevator or escalator
to go up to the second floor.
<p>

After going across the overbridge, there is a joint train station of JR
line and Nankai line. Nankai line only goes to the southern part of
the downtown Osaka (Namba), so do not use that line.
<p>

At manned ticket counter of JR, you'll say "Kyoto, Haruka". (Or you
may be  brave enough to try automatic vending machine.)
 All Haruka seats need reservation but the tickets with reservation
would be easily bought at the KIX station. The fair is 1,830 Yen basic
fair plus 1,860 Yen limited express charge (total 3,690 Yen). It
leaves almost every 30 min. from 6AM to 10PM. It takes about 75 min.
<p>

At Kyoto station (final destination of Haruka), you follow the sign 
to Subway and get to the subway station. There is only one subway line,
called Karasuma Line, going through Kyoto station. At the subway
station, you buy a 260 Yen ticket to go to "Kokusaikaikan" (Japanese
translation of International Conference Hall). Kokusaikaikan station
is the northern terminal of Karasuma Line.
<p>

The subway  to Kokusaikaikan comes every 5-10 min. The final
destination, Kokusaikaikan is the tenth station from Kyoto.
<p>

At Kokusaikaikan station, you would easily find the direction of
Conference Hall and Prince Hotel. You will follow the sign and go up
to the ground where you'll easily find signboard and recognize
Conference Hall and Prince Hotel. Both Conference Hall and Prince
Hotel are about 5 min. walk.
<p>
<p>
<H2> How to Reach Kyoto International Conference Hall and Prince Hotel
from JR and Kintetsu Kyoto Station </H2></A>

You will arrive at Kyoto Station by Shinkansen (Bullet Train) from
Tokyo, or by Kintetsu Line from Ise-Shima. In Kyoto Station, there are JR
Shinkansen Line (Bullet Train Line), JR Tokaido Line (Kose Line also),
JR San'in Line, JR Nara Line, Kintetsu Kyoto Line, and Subway Karasuma
Line. The way to the conference site and hotel is the same of above one
after arriving at Kyoto station. When you get to Kyoto station by
Shinkansen or Kintetsu, you would easily find the sign of the subway
station. Just follow the signs.
