Posters and Research Demonstrations</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Posters and Research Demonstrations provide an excellent
opportunity to show late-breaking results and to discuss the results with
the conference participants. Interactive communication and demonstration
will be the most exciting and powerful presentation.</FONT>
<DIR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Posters</FONT>: </B>All types of work in software
engineering can be presented effectively using posters during the conference.
Display space will be provided in the poster and research demonstration
room. A description of each poster will appear in the proceedings for posters
and research demonstrations.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Research Demonstrations</FONT>: </B>Research demonstrations
are intended to show early implementation of novel software engineering
concepts. Research demonstrations will be scheduled into blocks of time
for demonstration. In addition, a booth will be provided in the poster
and research demonstration room to allow informal demonstrations throughout
the conference. A description of each research demonstration will appear
in the proceedings for research demonstrations. We consider any system
which is at least six months away from appearing in a commercial product
as a "research system". Commercial systems will not be accepted as research
demonstrations.</DIR>
