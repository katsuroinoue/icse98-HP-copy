FORGING NEW LINKS</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>ICSE's twentieth birthday affords an opportunity to reflect
on profound changes of the past two decades. Since ICSE's founding, politics
and technology have converged to shatter once formidable barriers to international
cooperation.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The collapse of the Berlin Wall symbolizes the end of
the Cold War, and links in a Web page are a metaphor for our enhanced capacity
for global information exchange. In this spirit, we have worked hard to
ensure that ICSE98 will see an unprecedented increase in the level of international
participation and provide an opportunity to highlight the interests and
accomplishments of members from the Asian-Pacific region.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet our outreach must extend beyond geography. As we continue
to build bridges to other software disciplines, researchers and practitioners
in allied fields will benefit from an understanding of the contributions
that software engineering can make to their work. In turn, we must address
their problems in our research.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>New collaborations between academia and industry will
also enrich ICSE98 and our profession as a whole. The presentation of top-notch
papers will, of course, constitute the core activity of ICSE98. Cutting
edge research will be showcased in technical paper sessions, workshops,
panels, posters, demonstrations, and special sessions devoted to the lessons
learned from building large and complex software systems.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity
to meet new colleagues, exchange ideas, and explore the nearly limitless
possibilities that lie ahead. Join us in Kyoto for ICSE98 and share the
excitement that comes from forging new links.</FONT>
