<H2> How to Reach Kyoto International Conference Hall and Prince Hotel
from Kansai International Airport KIX </H2></A>
<p>

There are several choices to get to the conference site, but we show a
typical one here.
<p>

Limited express train "Haruka" served by JR goes directly from KIX
station to Kyoto station.
<p>

You'll arrive at the international arrival of the first floor of KIX
building. There is an overbridge from the second floor of the airport
building to the airport station, so you'll use elevator or escalator
to go up to the second floor.
<p>

After going across the overbridge, there is a joint train station of JR
line and Nankai line. Nankai line only goes to the southern part of
the downtown Osaka (Namba), so do not use that line.
<p>

At manned ticket counter of JR, you'll say "Kyoto, Haruka". (Or you
may be  brave enough to try automatic vending machine.)
 All Haruka seats need reservation but the tickets with reservation
would be easily bought at the KIX station. The fair is 1,830 Yen basic
fair plus 1,660 Yen limited express charge (total 3,490 Yen). It
leaves almost every 30 min. from 6AM to 10PM. It takes about 75 min.
<p>

At Kyoto station (final destination of Haruka), you follow the sign 
to Subway and get to the subway station. There is only one subway line,
called Karasuma Line, going through Kyoto station. At the subway
station, you buy  a 260 Yen ticket to go to "Kokusaikaikan" (Japanese
translation of International Conference Hall). Kokusaikaikan station
is the northern terminal of Karasuma Line. 
<p>

You would have to use automatic vending machine to get subway ticket
at almost all subway stations, but it is easy. At first, you check the 
fair by signboard above the vending machines. Then, you  put enough
coins or a bill to the machine, and  push a button with listed
fair. The ticket and changes will come out.
 <p>

The subway  to Kokusaikaikan comes every 5-10 min. The final
destination, Kokusaikaikan is the tenth station from Kyoto.
<p>

At Kokusaikaikan station, you would easily find the direction of
Conference Hall and Prince Hotel. You will follow the sign and go up
to the ground where you'll easily find signboard and recognize
Conference Hall and Prince Hotel. Both Conference Hall and Prince
Hotel are about 5 min. walk.
<p>
<p>
<H2> How to Reach Kyoto International Conference Hall and Prince Hotel
from JR and Kintetsu Kyoto Station </H2></A>

You will arrive at Kyoto Station by Shinkansen (Bullet Train) from
Tokyo, or by Kintetsu Line from Ise-Shima. In Kyoto Station, there are JR
Shinkansen Line (Bullet Train Line), JR Tokaido Line (Kose Line also),
JR San'in Line, JR Nara Line, Kintetsu Kyoto Line, and Subway Karasuma
Line. The way to the conference site and hotel is the same of above one
after arriving at Kyoto station. When you get to Kyoto station by
Shinkansen or Kintetsu, you would easily find the sign of the subway
station. Just follow the signs.
