WELCOME TO KYOTO IN CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON</H1>

<H2>
CITY OF HISTORY AND LEARNING</H2>
Kyoto, a city with 1,200 years of history, is the cultural soul of Japan.
Nestled among low mountains, it is blessed with both natural beauty and
a rich historical legacy. It is the ideal site for international conventions.
From its establishment as Japan's capital in 794 until the Meiji Restoration
in 1868, Kyoto flourished as the center of government, commerce and culture
in Japan. Traditional arts and an abundance of shrines and temples give
the city its distinct character. With nearly 1.5 million residents, Kyoto
is a vibrant mixture of old and new. Many high-tech firms have chosen it
as their headquarters, and the city boasts 47 public and private colleges
and universities. These significant intellectual resources combine with
Kyoto's long history and tradition to provide an ideal milieu for innovation
and creativity.
<H2>
NATURAL BEAUTY</H2>
Kyoto is a panorama of the changing seasons: from the springtime cherry
blossoms lining narrow walkways, the lush greenery of summer, to the brilliant
autumn foliage of Japanese maples and the delicate layer of snow covering
the surrounding mountainsides in winter. The passage of seasons is also
evident in the beautiful gardens of Kyoto's ancient temples and shrines.
<H2>
CULTURAL HERITAGE</H2>
Reflecting its long history as the cultural and religious center of Japan,
Kyoto is home to nearly 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. The
city's international cultural significance was recognized when 17 historical
sites in Kyoto were designated as UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.
Kyoto is the location of 20% of Japan's national treasures. More than 60
museums throughout the city offer visitors the opportunity to view priceless
works of art and important cultural objects.
<H2>
KYOTO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HALL</H2>
Japan's leading convention center, the <A HREF="http://www.joho-kyoto.or.jp/KICH/index_e.html">Kyoto
International Conference Hall</A>, is a complex consisting of seven separate
conference halls, the largest of which can hold 2,000 persons. Another
70 conference rooms of various sizes are available for smaller meetings.
Two large banquet halls and a Japanese landscape garden offer additional
settings for convention participants to meet and communicate informally.
