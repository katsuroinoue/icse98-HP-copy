Doctoral Symposium</H1>
Doctoral Symposium Chair: <B>Tetsuo Tamai</B>, University of Tokyo (Japan)

<P>The ICSE 98 Doctoral Symposium is a one day workshop prior to the regular
ICSE technical conference. The goal of the doctoral symposium is to publicly
discuss research goals, methods, and results at an early enough stage in
Ph.D. research to provide useful guidance in completion of the dissertation
research and initiation of a research career. The symposium and ICSE will
also provide an opportunity for student participants to interact with established
researchers and others in the wider software engineering community.

<P>A limited number of student participants will be offered support in
the form of complementary admission to the symposium and ICSE 98.
<H2>
Deadline</H2>
<B>1 November 1997</B>
<BR>5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.
<H2>
Who should submit?</H2>
Student participants should consider participating in the doctoral Symposium
at least six months before completion of their dissertation, but after
having settled on a research area or thesis topic.
<H2>
Review process</H2>
Each prospective student participant will submit a package of materials
for consideration by the Symposium organizing committee. The committee
will select participants on the basis of their anticipated contribution
to the workshop goals. Among the criteria that will be considered in reviewing
submissions are:
<UL>
<LI>
The quality of the research, as evidenced by submitted materials, and its
relevance to software engineering.</LI>

<LI>
The stage of the research. The organizers will seek to select students
across a range of research stages.</LI>

<LI>
Diversity of background, research topic, and approach.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
How to submit</H2>
To apply as a student participant in the Doctoral Symposium, prepare a
submission package consisting of three parts listed below. Each of these
parts must be submitted electronically by the listed deadlines.

Research Abstract</H3>
Submit an abstract describing your dissertation research. Your abstract
should be at least 2 pages, but not more than 5 pages long, when prepared
according to the format guidelines below.

<P>The research abstract should clearly indicate:
<UL>
<LI>
The title of your work.</LI>

<LI>
The research area or sub-area of your work.</LI>

<LI>
The relation of your research to prior work in that area.</LI>

<LI>
The expected contribution of your dissertation research.</LI>

<LI>
The methods you are using or will use to carry out your research. It is
particularly important to describe a plan for evaluating your work and
presenting credible evidence of your results to the research community.</LI>
</UL>
Students at relatively early stages of their research will have some difficulty
addressing some of these areas. Nonetheless, each prospective student participant
should address them as well as possible.
<H3>
Letter of recommendation</H3>
