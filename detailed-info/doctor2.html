<P>The ICSE 98 Doctoral Symposium is a one day workshop prior to the regular
ICSE technical conference. The goal of the doctoral symposium is to
publicly discuss research goals, methods, and results at an early enough
stage in Ph.D. research to provide useful guidance in completion of the
dissertation research and initiation of a research career. The symposium
and ICSE will also provide an opportunity for student participants to
interact with established researchers and others in the wider software
engineering community.

<P>A limited number of student participants will be offered support in the
form of complementary admission to the symposium and ICSE 98.

<H2>Deadline</H2>

<b>1 November 1997</b><BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.

<H2>Who should submit?</H2>

<P>Student participants should consider participating in the doctoral
Symposium at least six months before completion of their dissertation, but
after having settled on a research area or thesis topic.

<H2>Review process</H2>

<P>Each prospective student participant will submit a package of materials for
consideration by the Symposium organizing committee. The committee will
select participants on the basis of their anticipated contribution to the
workshop goals. Among the criteria that will be considered in reviewing
submissions are:
<UL>
<LI>The quality of the research, as evidenced by submitted materials, and
    its relevance to software engineering.
<LI>The stage of the research. The organizers will seek to select students 
    across a range of research stages.
<LI>Diversity of background, research topic, and approach.
</UL>

<H2>How to submit</H2>

<P>To apply as a student participant in the Doctoral Symposium, prepare a
submission package consisting of three parts listed below.  Each of these
parts must be submitted electronically by the listed deadlines.

<H3>General Information</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Name of Student Participant
<LI>Name of thesis Advisor
<LI>University and Department
<LI>Full mailing address (repeat information from above as needed),
    including country and postal code.
<LI>Telephone
<LI>Fax
<LI>Electronic mail address
<LI>Electronic mail address of thesis advisor
<LI>Universal resource locator (URL), if available
<LI>Related submissions (e.g., if you are also submitting a technical paper
    to ICSE)
<LI>Brief description of research topic (25 words or less)
<LI>2 to 5 key words and phrases
</UL>

<H3>Research Abstract</H3>

<P>Submit an abstract describing your dissertation research. Your abstract
should be at least 2 pages, but not more than 5 pages long, when prepared
according to the format guidelines below.

<P>The research abstract should clearly indicate:
<UL>
<LI>The title of your work.
<LI>The research area or sub-area of your work.
<LI>The relation of your research to prior work in that area.
<LI>The expected contribution of your dissertation research.
<LI>The methods you are using or will use to carry out your research. It is
particularly important to describe a plan for evaluating your work and
presenting credible evidence of your results to the research community.
</UL>

<P>Students at relatively early stages of their research will have some
difficulty addressing some of these areas. Nonetheless, each prospective
student participant should address them as well as possible.

<H3>Letter of recommendation</H3>

<P>Ask your thesis advisor to submit a letter of recommendation to
<a href="mailto:icse98-phd@graco.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp">icse98-phd@graco.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp</a>.
The letter of recommendation must include an
assessment of the current status of your thesis research, and an expected
date for thesis submission.

<H2>Format</H2>

<P>The general information packet and letter of recommendation should be
plain ASCII text with no markup.

<P>Research abstracts may be submitted in any of the following formats:
<UL>
<LI>Level 1 PostScript, with all fonts included except Times, Helvetica,
    and Symbol.
<LI>Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
<LI>Plain ASCII text with no markup
</UL>

<P>Each research abstract must be a single file. Typeset abstracts should be
set in 12 point type on a 14 point baseline, with 1 inch margins on all
sides.  Please note that this format is for initial submissions only.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Notification of acceptance or rejection will be transmitted
electronically by 10 December 1997.

<P>Final versions of thesis abstracts for inclusion in the second
volume of the proceedings are due by 15 February 1998. These abstracts
must be prepared according to the ICSE Conference Proceedings
format. Signed copyright release forms are also due by 15 February
1998.
