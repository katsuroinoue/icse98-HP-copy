</FONT><B><P>AIM</B><FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>The aim of the ICSE 98 panels is to stimulate discussion about ideas and issues of crucial importance to the software engineering community. Panels may emphasize complex technical issues, but they may equally provide an opportunity to propose views and address controversies through the medium of informed debate. Suitable topics for such discussion include pressing issues in software engineering theory and practice, emerging industry trends and enabling technologies, and professional, organizational, and social issues associated with software engineering. Panels last about 90 minutes and can be organized in many formats. We strongly encourage proposals in original formats that will engage the panelists and audience in a lively and substantive discussion. </P>
<P>Panels may address any topic of relevance to software engineering research and practice. Panels are an opportunity to stimulate thinking about how software engineering is evolving. This means that topics need not be limited to the conventional boundaries of the field.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><B><P>REVIEW PROCESS</B><FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>Each proposal will be reviewed by the program co-chairs. We are looking for stimulating and timely proposals that will be debated by well-informed and engaging panelists and that will form a diverse, controversial, and well thought out collection. Please feel free to contact either program co-chair in advance to discuss your proposal.</P>
