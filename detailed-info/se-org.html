<P><B>DEADLINE</B>

<P>Reports: 1 December 1997

<P><B>AIM</B>

<P>Lessons and Status Reports were introduced to the ICSE program at ICSE97.
The reports are intended to provide software engineering professionals
with a picture of practices, procedures, techniques, products, and organizational
structures. Our goal is to provide software engineers and managers with:
<UL>
<LI>
insights that can be adapted and applied within their own work practices
and organizations;</LI>

<LI>
information on the activities of software engineering practitioners doing
innovative and potentially influential work;</LI>

<LI>
information on software engineering activities which form the basis for
future generations of software engineering tools, techniques and management.</LI>
</UL>
<B>SCOPE</B>

<P>We encourage submissions from institutions, organizations, and groups
within companies, universities, and government. Submissions may be from
organizations of any size and any maturity level, ranging from small software
development teams to larger teams of professional software developers working
in large companies. We also encourage submissions

<P>describing a broad range of applications, from single-user PC software
to global, enterprise-wide solutions.

<P>Reports may describe software engineering activities in;
<UL>
<LI>
Software planning, acquisition, and integration organizations,</LI>

<LI>
Software development and maintenance organizations,</LI>

<LI>
Software engineering process groups or consultatory organizations,</LI>

<LI>
Quality assurance groups or independent products evaluators,</LI>

<LI>
Collaborative efforts involving several groups or organizations,</LI>

<LI>
Partnerships of different types of groups, or</LI>

<LI>
Groups cooperating across geographical, political, or cultural boundaries.</LI>
</UL>
We are looking for lessons, procedures, techniques and products, including
new perspectives on old but as yet unsolved problems, that stimulate practicing
software engineers, R&amp;D organizations, and software engineering researchers,
and that can be learned and applied.

<P>Examples of topics may include but are not limited to:
<UL>
<LI>
Assessment and transfer of new technologies, including education, training
and supporting issues.</LI>

<LI>
Planning and implementation of a new methodology into an organization;</LI>

<LI>
Experience in the application of CASE Tools;</LI>

<LI>
Practice of process design, process assessment and process improvement;</LI>

<LI>
Application of software quality metrics and evaluation practice;</LI>

<LI>
Experience on some aspects of the application of innovative software engineering
techniques in organizations.</LI>
</UL>
The submissions should emphasize;
<UL>
<LI>
the circumstances under which work is done;</LI>

<LI>
the underlying goals, policies, and organizational background;</LI>

<LI>
perspectives of past, present, and future software engineering efforts.</LI>
</UL>
We aim to bring together people to report about their practice with the
focus on giving the "big picture" rather than a technically interesting
focus on a single scientific result.

<P><B>REVIEW PROCESS</B>

<P>Submissions will be reviewed for acceptance based on: the interest to
members of the software engineering community; the significance of impact
of the report to the Software Engineering community; and the objective
of informing the software engineering community activities world wide.

<P>Submissions are solicited from organizations. Solicited proposals will
be subject to the same review process and criteria as proposals submitted
in response to this call.

<P><B>HOW TO SUBMIT</B>

<P>Proposed Lessons and Status Reports must be prepared in the <A HREF="proceedings-format.html">Conference
Proceedings Format</A>. Proposals must not exceed 4 pages in length.

<P>Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. The
primary author of each accepted report will receive an Author Kit with
detailed instructions on how to submit camera-ready materials for publication.

<P>At the conference, the Status Report should be presented by a major
participant in the work. The presentation should be based on the material
described in the Status Report Summary.
