<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The ICSE'98 Tutorials Program
provides conference participants with the opportunity to gain
new insights, knowledge and skills in a broad range of areas in
the field of software engineering. Participants at the tutorials
include software professionals, teachers, researchers and students
both in software engineering and in other areas seeking to gain
a better understanding of software engineering topics. Proposals
for full-day (6 hours) or half-day (3 hours) tutorials are solicited.
Tutorial topics are expected to cover a wide range, from practical
guidelines, standards and surveys to academic and theoretical
issues. The topics are not limited to past ICSE tutorial offerings.</FONT>

be considered also include: relevance, timeliness, importance
and audience appeal; suitability for presentation in a half- or
full-day tutorial format; effectiveness of teaching methods; and
past experience and qualifications of instructors. </FONT>
