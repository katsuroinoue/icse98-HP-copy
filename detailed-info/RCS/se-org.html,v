<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Lessons and Status Reports
were introduced to the ICSE program at ICSE97. The reports are
intended to provide software engineering professionals with a
picture of practices, procedures, techniques, products, and organizational
structures. Our goal is to provide software engineers and managers
with: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">insights that can be adapted
and applied within their own work practices and organizations;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">information on the activities
of software engineering practitioners doing innovative and potentially
influential work;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">information on software
engineering activities which form the basis for future generations
of software engineering tools, techniques and management.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">SCOPE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">We encourage submissions from
institutions, organizations, and groups within companies, universities,
and government. Submissions may be from organizations of any size
and any maturity level, ranging from small software development
teams to larger teams of professional software developers working
in large companies. We also encourage submissions</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">describing a broad range of
applications, from single-user PC software to global, enterprise-wide
solutions. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Reports may describe software
engineering activities in;</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Software planning, acquisition,
and integration organizations,</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Software development and
maintenance organizations,</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Software engineering process
groups or consultatory organizations,</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Quality assurance groups
or independent products evaluators,</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Collaborative efforts
involving several groups or organizations,</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Partnerships of different
types of groups, or</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Groups cooperating across
geographical, political, or cultural boundaries.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">We are looking for lessons,
procedures, techniques and products, including new perspectives
on old but as yet unsolved problems, that stimulate practicing
software engineers, R&amp;D organizations, and software engineering
researchers, and that can be learned and applied.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Examples of topics may include
but are not limited to:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Assessment and transfer
of new technologies, including education, training and supporting
issues.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Planning and implementation
of a new methodology into an organization;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Experience in the application
of CASE Tools;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Practice of process design,
process assessment and process improvement;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Application of software
quality metrics and evaluation practice;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Experience on some aspects
of the application of innovative software engineering techniques
in organizations. </FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The submissions should emphasize;</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">the circumstances under
which work is done;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">the underlying goals,
policies, and organizational background;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">perspectives of past,
present, and future software engineering efforts.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">We aim to bring together people
to report about their practice with the focus on giving the &quot;big
picture&quot; rather than a technically interesting focus on a
single scientific result. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">REVIEW PROCESS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Submissions will be reviewed
for acceptance based on: the interest to members of the software
engineering community; the significance of impact of the report
to the Software Engineering community; and the objective of informing
the software engineering community activities world wide.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Submissions are solicited
from organizations. Solicited proposals will be subject to the
same review process and criteria as proposals submitted in response
to this call. </FONT>

how to submit camera-ready materials for publication. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">At the conference, the Status
Report should be presented by a major participant in the work.
The presentation should be based on the material described in
the Status Report Summary. </FONT>
