<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">ICSE'98 will host a forum
for graduate students to present and discuss their dissertation
research objectives, approaches and preliminary results. Doctoral
students, who are within approximately one year of thesis completion,
are invited to apply to the Doctoral Symposium, a closed session
in which a group of students present their research and get useful
guidance and comments from established researchers and other doctoral
students. The one-day symposium aims to broaden the perspectives
of new entrants to the software engineering research community
and to provide constructive comments on the ongoing thesis research.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">As the systems of doctoral
courses are different by cultures, we are expecting participants
coming from America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and all over the world.
We plan to invite people from typical academic cultures to explain
their doctoral systems so that we can compare and discuss differences
between countries.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">We are looking for students
who are advanced enough to have a specific research proposal and
some preliminary results, but with sufficient time remaining to
thesis completion to benefit from the symposium experience. Application
forms for describing the thesis topic and progress are available
from the Symposium chair. A letter of recommendation from the
student's thesis advisor is also required. The applications are
reviewed by the committee, and acceptance and rejection will be
notified. Students selected as participants will receive partial
reimbursement for conference-related expenses.</FONT>
