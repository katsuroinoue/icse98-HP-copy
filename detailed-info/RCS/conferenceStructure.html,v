<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The annual International Conference
on Software Engineering (ICSE) is the leading forum for the exchange
of ideas on all aspects of software engineering. ICSE98 invites
you to submit work to share with the ICSE community.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Different classes of contributions
are sought, ranging from research papers to lessons and status
reports from software engineering organizations. The ultimate
goal is to build a rich and comprehensive conference program that
can fit the interests and needs of different classes of attendees:
professionals, researchers, managers, and students. If you are
unsure of which category to submit to, please consult the co-chairs
in charge of specific events you may be interested in. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">You may prepare as many submissions
as you like in the same or different categories. In a given category,
the same materials should be presented only once.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">In keeping with the international
character of past ICSEs, the written and spoken language of the
conference is English.</FONT>
