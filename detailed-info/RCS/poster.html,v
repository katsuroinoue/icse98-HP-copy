<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Research demonstrations are intended to show
early implementation of novel software engineering concepts. Research
demonstrations will be scheduled into blocks of time for demonstration.
In addition, a booth will be provided in the poster and research
demonstration room to allow informal demonstrations throughout
the conference. A description of each research demonstration will
appear in the proceedings for research demonstrations. We consider
any system which is at least six months away from appearing in
a commercial product as a &quot;research system&quot;. Commercial
systems will not be accepted as research demonstrations.</FONT>
