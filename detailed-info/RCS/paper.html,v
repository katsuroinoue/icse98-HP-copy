<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Papers describe innovative
and significant work in the research and practice of Software
Engineering. Papers are collected in an archival, refereed conference
proceedings, published by IEEE/ACM, which is cited and read by
researchers and practitioners world-wide. Accepted papers are
presented at the ICSE conference, attended by hundreds of people.
Having a paper on the technical program gives authors an opportunity
to have a tremendous impact on the study and application of Software
Engineering principles, theory, and techniques.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The Software Engineering community
consists of researchers and professionals from many different
disciplines and intellectual traditions. The paper review process
tries to rigorously review all submissions in a manner that takes
into account the different criteria from different parts of the
community. For reviewers to do this effectively, they need an
accurate assessment of the type of each paper they read; that
is, research contributions or experience papers. Please select
the type of paper that best describes your submission and write
it in the appropriate place on the Cover Page (see the home page).
If you feel that your submission does not fit any of these types,
please contact either program co-chair for help in best classifying
your submission.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">REVIEW PROCESS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Each submitted paper will
be reviewed by a group of at least three members of the program
committee. Reviewer assignment will be done by matching the topic
and focus of the paper with committee member expertise. The committee
members will develop a summary review and recommendation for acceptance
or rejection. Final decisions will be made at a program committee
meeting, where the committee as a whole will review the recommendations
and rationale made by committee members.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Note that in addition to considering
the criteria outlined for each type of paper (see the ICSE98 Home
Page), all papers will be evaluated for overall quality of presentation:
the problem and its context must be clearly described, including
relation to prior work. It must also be clear from the presentation
that a succinct, high quality verbal presentation at the conference
will be possible.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">HOW TO SUBMIT</FONT></B>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">If you decide to submit, you
should look into the ICSE98 Home Page to get the necessary information

the paper submission. </FONT>
