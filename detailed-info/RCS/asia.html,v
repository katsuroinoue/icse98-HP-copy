<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">ICSE98 provides an opportunity
for exchanging ideas and/or information for researchers and practitioners
in Asia-Pacific Region. At ICSE18 in Seattle 1994, we had a workshop
on &quot;Asian Approaches to Software Engineering&quot;. It was
very successful. We are planning to have a similar event in Kyoto.
And it will also be possible to implement other plans such as
to have a forum to discuss emerging Asian software markets, or
for special exhibits of software engineering tools made in Asia.
