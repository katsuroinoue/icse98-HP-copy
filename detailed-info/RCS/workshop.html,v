<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Workshops provide a forum
for a group of participants to exchange opinions on topics in
either research or applications. Workshops are held either before
or after the conference and may be one, one and a half or two
days in length. Workshops are not alternative forums for full
papers which otherwise could be submitted to ICSE. Participation
in workshops is typically dependent on submission of position
statements.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Workshop proposals will be
reviewed by a committee representing a cross-section of software
engineering researchers and professionals. Acceptance will be
based on an evaluation of the workshop's potential for generating
useful results, the timeliness and expected interest level in
the topic, and organizer's ability to lead a successful workshop.</FONT>
