</FONT><P>Every year ICSE submissions from people unfamiliar with the ICSE community are rejected because authors do not understand the expectations for an ICSE submission. We are consequently missing many interesting viewpoints. If you are not familiar with how to write a good ICSE submission, please ask for a mentor. A mentor is a person who helps you learn something unfamiliar through a personal one-on-one relationship. </P>
<P>If you want to ask for a mentor we will need to hear from you no later than 10 weeks prior to the submission deadline for the chosen category. We highly recommend that you request a mentor even earlier. </P>
<P>You may need a mentor to help you choose a type of papers, or to help you figure out how to prepare your submission, or both. The mentor does not prepare the submission for you but helps you do a better job of it yourself. The mentor addresses questions such as, but not limited to: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Are the issues addressed relevant to the ICSE community? How could the work be made more relevant? </LI>
<LI>Is the work adequately related to and differentiated from other relevant work that ICSE community members are likely to be familiar with? </LI>
<LI>Is the information given about methodology and results at the right level of detail and rigor for an ICSE audience? </LI></UL>

<P>We expect mentoring will be most useful for participants that have not traditionally contributed to ICSE (e.g., from a particular application domain). However, mentoring is available to any submitter on a first come, first serve basis. Please note that there are no guarantees that participating in this program will ensure that your submission will be accepted by the review committee. The mentoring process is completely independent of the review process. </P>
<P>The mentor does not become a co-author. The mentor need not appear in the acknowledgments of an accepted submission, as mentoring is a private matter between mentor and submitter. In the Proceedings, we will have a page listing those who mentored to acknowledge their contribution, but acknowledgment is completely separate from an individual submission. </P>
<P>We have limited resources (volunteers) available, so mentors will be assigned on a first come, first served basis. Act early, since the feedback given by the mentor may suggest extensive modifications to the submission, which cannot easily be done at the last minute. </P>
<P>In ICSE98, mentoring is available for technical papers submissions. Ask for a mentor for technical papers by contacting one of Papers Co-Chairs through electronic mail. </P>
