<P><B>AIM</B>

<P>The ICSE'98 Tutorials Program provides conference participants with
the opportunity to gain new insights, knowledge and skills in a broad range
of areas in the field of software engineering. Participants at the tutorials
include software professionals, teachers, researchers and students both
in software engineering and in other areas seeking to gain a better understanding
of software engineering topics. Proposals for full-day (6 hours) or half-day
(3 hours) tutorials are solicited. Tutorial topics are expected to cover
a wide range, from practical guidelines, standards and surveys to academic
and theoretical issues. The topics are not limited to past ICSE tutorial
offerings.

<P><B>REVIEW PROCESS</B>

<P>Submitted proposals will be reviewed and evaluated by a committee consisting
of experts based on their estimated benefit for the prospective participants
and on their fit within the tutorial program as a whole. Factors to be
considered also include: relevance, timeliness, importance and audience
appeal; suitability for presentation in a half- or full-day tutorial format;
effectiveness of teaching methods; and past experience and qualifications
of instructors.
