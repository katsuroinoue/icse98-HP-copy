<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The aim of the ICSE 98 panels
is to stimulate discussion about ideas and issues of crucial importance
to the software engineering community. Panels may emphasize complex
technical issues, but they may equally provide an opportunity
to propose views and address controversies through the medium
of informed debate. Suitable topics for such discussion include
pressing issues in software engineering theory and practice, emerging
industry trends and enabling technologies, and professional, organizational,
and social issues associated with software engineering. Panels
last about 90 minutes and can be organized in many formats. We
strongly encourage proposals in original formats that will engage
the panelists and audience in a lively and substantive discussion.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Panels may address any topic
of relevance to software engineering research and practice. Panels
are an opportunity to stimulate thinking about how software engineering
is evolving. This means that topics need not be limited to the
conventional boundaries of the field.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Each proposal will be reviewed
by the program co-chairs. We are looking for stimulating and timely
proposals that will be debated by well-informed and engaging panelists
and that will form a diverse, controversial, and well thought
out collection. Please feel free to contact either program co-chair
in advance to discuss your proposal.<BR>
