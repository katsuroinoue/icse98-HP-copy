<P>Papers describe innovative and significant work in the research and
practice of Software Engineering. Papers are collected in an archival,
refereed conference proceedings, published by IEEE/ACM, which is cited
and read by researchers and practitioners world-wide. Accepted papers are
presented at the ICSE98 conference, attended by hundreds of people. Having
a paper on the technical program gives authors an opportunity to have a
tremendous impact on the study and application of Software Engineering
principles, theory, and techniques.

<P><!-- TYPES OF PAPERS --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TYPES OF PAPERS</FONT></B>

<P>The Software Engineering community consists of researchers and professionals
from many different disciplines and intellectual traditions. The paper
review process tries to rigorously review all submissions in a manner that
takes into account the different criteria from different parts of the community.
For reviewers to do this effectively, they need an accurate assessment
of the type of each paper they read. Please select a type of paper from
the following list that best describes your submission and write it in
the appropriate place on <B><A HREF="coverpage.html">the Cover Page</A></B>.
If you feel that your submission does not fit any of these types, or if
it seems to match more than one type description, please contact a Papers
Co-Chair for help in best classifying your submission.</fonts>

<DT>
Theory Papers:</DT>

<DD>
Theory Papers describe principles, concepts, or models on which work in
Software Engineering might be based; authors of theoretical papers are
expected to position their ideas within a broad context of Software Engineering
frameworks and theories. Review criteria include the originality and soundness
of the analysis provided, as well as the relevance of the theoretical content
to Software Engineering practice and/or research.</DD>

<DT>
Systems Papers:</DT>

<DD>
Systems Papers describe novel technology for any aspect of software engineering.
Review criteria include the originality and relevance of the system's architecture
and behavior with respect to the existing state-of-the-art. Authors should
be clear to what extent the system has been implemented and applied in
practical circumstances.</DD>

<DT>
Empirical Papers:</DT>

<DD>
Empirical Papers describe the collection and interpretation of data concerning
the use of software engineering methods, techniques, and tools. Data might
include interviews, observations, surveys, or experimental manipulations.
Both qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection and analysis
are welcome. Review criteria include the appropriateness and rationale
for the methods of data collection and analysis, and the significance of
the conclusions for practice or research in Software Engineering.</DD>

<B>Experience Reports</B></LI>

<BR>Experience Papers describe the application of software engineering
methods, theory or tools to the development of significant software products.
Review criteria include the value of the reflections abstracted from the
experience and their relevance to other designers or to researchers working
on related methods, theory or tools.
<LI>
<B>Opinion Papers</B></LI>

<BR>Opinion papers present the author's well-supported opinion about some
aspect of Software Engineering. Review criteria include the impact and
quality of the argumentation, including the experience (research or practice)
used to support the opinion. Authors of opinion papers are urged to contact
one of the Papers Co-Chairs in advance of submitting a paper, to get feedback
on their idea, since ICSE rarely accepts opinion papers.</UL>
<!-- REVIEW PROCESS --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>REVIEW PROCESS</FONT></B>

<P>Paper submissions to ICSE98 are reviewed rigorously by <B><A HREF="member.html">the
Program Committee</A></B>, who are volunteers drawn from the international
technical community of Software Engineering researchers and professionals.
Because there is no revision cycle, the content and presentation of submitted
papers must be essentially acceptable as received.

<P>Each submitted paper will be reviewed by a group of at least three members
of the program committee. Reviewer assignment will be done by matching
the topic and focus of the paper with committee member expertise. The committee
members will develop a summary review and recommendation for acceptance
or rejection. Final decisions will be made at a program committee meeting,
where the committee as a whole will review the recommendations and rationale
made by committee members.

<P>Note that in addition to considering the criteria outlined for each
type of paper, all papers will be evaluated for overall quality of presentation:
the problem and its context must be clearly described, including relation
to prior work. It must also be clear from the presentation that a succinct
(about 25-minute), high quality verbal presentation at the conference will
be possible.

<P><!-- UPON ACCEPTANCE --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>UPON ACCEPTANCE</FONT></B>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of November
1997. Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE98 Conference Proceedings.
The primary author of each accepted paper will receive an Author Kit with
detailed instructions on how to submit the camera-ready copy. The deadline
of the camera-ready copy is the end of January 1998.</dont>
