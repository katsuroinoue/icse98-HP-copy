<P>Panel Proposal: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">20 September 1997</FONT>

<P><!-- AIM --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>AIM</FONT></B>

<P>The aim of the ICSE98 panels is to stimulate discussion about ideas
and issues of crucial importance to the software engineering community.
Panels may emphasize complex technical issues, but they may equally provide
an opportunity to propose views and address controversies through the medium
of informed debate. Suitable topics for such discussion include pressing
issues in software engineering theory and practice, emerging industry trends
and enabling technologies, and professional, organizational, and social
issues associated with software engineering. Panels last about 90 minutes
and can be organized in many formats. We strongly encourage proposals in
original formats that will engage the panelists and audience in a lively
and substantive discussion.

<P>Panels may address any topic of relevance to software engineering research
and practice. Panels are an opportunity to stimulate thinking about how
software engineering is evolving. This means that topics need not be limited
to the conventional boundaries of the field.

<P><!-- EXAMPLE TYPES OF PANELS --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>EXAMPLE TYPES OF PANELS</FONT></B>

<P>Several panel format suggestions are provided below. However, we strongly
encourage proposals in original formats that will engage the panelists
and audience in a lively and substantive discussion.
<DL>
<DT>
<B>Analytic Panels</B></DT>

<DD>
An analytic panel analyzes and synthesizes current practices in the various
fields of software engineering. The panelists aim at introducing the audience
to new ideas and should therefore be technical experts selected from distinct
fields but addressing a single problem. Panelists should address the following
questions:</DD>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
How do their topic areas complement each other?</LI>

<LI>
How do we reconcile vocabulary, concepts and notations?</LI>

<LI>
How can their research results be transferred effectively to industrial
practice, and, conversely, how can industrial needs be recognized and addressed
by the research community?</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DD>
The biggest challenge in an analytic panel is to ensure it does not deteriorate
into a paper session. It is therefore essential that panelists' ideas are
explicitly interrelated and synthesized.</DD>

<DT>
<B>Comparative Panels</B></DT>

<DD>
In a comparative panel, panelists compare distinct approaches, techniques
and models to a particular problem. Panelists should explain why their
approach is better than everyone else's (and not merely assert that it
is). The panel should aim at identifying the common philosophy among the
approaches represented in the panel, and on what crucial distinctions (as
opposed to accidental details) their differences depend. A comparative
panel should be controversial, but the panelists should treat each other's
approaches with respect. Panelists should be technical experts within the
same field.</DD>

<DD>
The biggest challenge with a comparative panel is to ensure that the panelists
understand and respect each other's approaches and do not see the panel
as an opportunity for a sales job. One technique is to have each panelist
present "someone else's" approach as positively as possible.</DD>

<DT>
<B>Exercises</B></DT>

<DD>
In an exercise, the aim is to have panelists solve a small but representative
problem, using their chosen approach and with little preparation. In suitable
circumstances, the problem scenario could be revealed to the panelists
at the start of the session itself. The problem scenario will be selected
in advance by the moderator of the session.</DD>

<DD>
The biggest challenges with an exercise are to ensure that the panelists
are prepared and that the audience goes away seeing the forest, not just
the trees. For an excercise panel to achieve any closure, it is essential
that the moderator be able to summarize at the end of the session the key
similarities and differences among the panelists' approaches.</DD>

<DT>
<B>Predictive Panels</B></DT>

<DD>
In a predictive panel, panelists from different fields discuss the ways
in which emerging techniques and technologies will affect the practice
of software engineering in the future. Panelists should be experts in their
relevant fields and should have clear ideas about how work in their fields
is influencing the future.</DD>

<DD>
The challenge with a predictive panel is to avoid idle speculation and
waffling. The key idea is careful selection of the topic and panelists.</DD>
</DL>
<!-- TOPICS --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPICS</FONT></B>

<P>Panels may address any topic of relevance to software engineering research
and practice. Panels are an opportunity to stimulate thinking about how
software engineering is evolving. This means that topics need not be limited
to the conventional boundaries of the field.

<P><!-- REVIEW PROCESS --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>REVIEW PROCESS</FONT></B>

<P>Each proposal will be reviewed by the program co-chairs. We are looking
for stimulating and timely proposals that will be debated by well-informed
and engaging panelists and that will form a diverse, controversial, and
well thought out collection. Please feel free to contact either program
co-chair in advance to discuss your proposal.

<P>Our criteria will include:
<UL>
<LI>
Clear emphasis on a well-defined topic, and the positions that the panelists
are likely to take;</LI>

<LI>
Relevance of the proposed topic to software engineering research or practice;</LI>

<LI>
Likelihood of debate and controversy;</LI>

<LI>
Demonstrated expertise of the panelists;</LI>

<LI>
Evidence of fresh thinking in the panel format.</LI>
</UL>
In summary, we will ask ourselves whether the average audience member will
go away from the panel with new and valuable ideas.

<P><!-- UPON ACCEPTANCE --><B><FONT SIZE=+1>UPON ACCEPTANCE</FONT></B>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of November
1996. A summary of each panel will appear in the conference proceedings.
The panel organizer is required to collate the half-page position papers
(or later revisions of them), together with an introduction into a summary
description of the panel. Panelists must agree to the half-page position
papers being published in the conference proceedings.

<P>Summaries of accepted panels will be published on the World Wide Web
in the pre-conference publicity. Panel organizers will be sent an author
kit for preparing camera-ready or electronic materials ready for publication.
These materials are due 1 Feburary 1998.

<P>Panel organizers are expected to help panelists prepare for participation
and coordinate the contributions of the panel.
