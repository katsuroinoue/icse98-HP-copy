</FONT><P>Papers describe innovative and significant work in the research and practice of Software Engineering. Papers are collected in an archival, refereed conference proceedings, published by IEEE/ACM, which is cited and read by researchers and practitioners world-wide. Accepted papers are presented at the ICSE conference, attended by hundreds of people. Having a paper on the technical program gives authors an opportunity to have a tremendous impact on the study and application of Software Engineering principles, theory, and techniques.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><B><P>SCOPE</B><FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>The Software Engineering community consists of researchers and professionals from many different disciplines and intellectual traditions. The paper review process tries to rigorously review all submissions in a manner that takes into account the different criteria from different parts of the community. For reviewers to do this effectively, they need an accurate assessment of the type of each paper they read; that is, research contributions or experience papers. Please select the type of paper that best describes your submission and write it in the appropriate place on the Cover Page (see the home page). If you feel that your submission does not fit any of these types, please contact either program co-chair for help in best classifying your submission.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><B><P>REVIEW PROCESS</B><FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>Each submitted paper will be reviewed by a group of at least three members of the program committee. Reviewer assignment will be done by matching the topic and focus of the paper with committee member expertise. The committee members will develop a summary review and recommendation for acceptance or rejection. Final decisions will be made at a program committee meeting, where the committee as a whole will review the recommendations and rationale made by committee members.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>Note that in addition to considering the criteria outlined for each type of paper (see the ICSE98 Home Page), all papers will be evaluated for overall quality of presentation: the problem and its context must be clearly described, including relation to prior work. It must also be clear from the presentation that a succinct, high quality verbal presentation at the conference will be possible.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><B><P>HOW TO SUBMIT</B><FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>If you decide to submit, you should look into the ICSE98 Home Page to get the necessary information for the submission! In particular, note that the deadline for requesting ICSE98 mentoring is 10 weeks before the deadline of the paper submission. </P>
<P>The following lists the steps you should follow for submitting a paper.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
