<P><B>DEADLINE</B>

<P>Proposals: 1 January 1998 (Contact the chair for late submission)

<P><B>AIM</B>

<P>Posters and Research Demonstrations provide an excellent opportunity
to show late-breaking results and to discuss the results with the conference
participants. Interactive communication and demonstration will be the most
exciting and powerful presentation.

<P><B>SCOPE</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Posters</LI>

<BR>All types of work in software engineering can be presented effectively
using posters during the conference. Display space will be provided in
the poster and research demonstration room. A description of each poster
will appear in the proceedings for posters and research demonstrations.
<LI>
Research Demonstrations</LI>

<BR>Research demonstrations are intended to show early implementation of
novel software engineering concepts. Research demonstrations will be scheduled
into blocks of time for demonstration. In addition, a booth will be provided
in the poster and research demonstration room to allow informal demonstrations
throughout the conference. A description of each research demonstration
will appear in the proceedings for research demonstrations. We consider
any system which is at least six months away from appearing in a commercial
product as a "research system". Commercial systems will not be accepted
as research demonstrations.</UL>
<B>REVIEW PROCESS</B>

<P>Submissions will be reviewed by the committee using the standard ICSE
criteria : originality, importance and generality of contribution, soundness
of rationale or demonstration, quality of written and graphic presentation
and appropriate citation of relevant literature.

<P><B>COMPUTING AND PROJECTION EQUIPMENT</B>

<P>The conference will not provide any electronic equipment such as CPUs,
disk drives, displays or videotapes for demonstration or presentation.

<P><B>HOW TO SUBMIT</B>

<P>Authors should prepare a four page description of their poster and research
demonstration proposal for review.
