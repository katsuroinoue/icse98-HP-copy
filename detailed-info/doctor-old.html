</FONT><P>ICSE'98 will host a forum for graduate students to present and discuss their dissertation research objectives, approaches and preliminary results. Doctoral students, who are within approximately one year of thesis completion, are invited to apply to the Doctoral Symposium, a closed session in which a group of students present their research and get useful guidance and comments from established researchers and other doctoral students. The one-day symposium aims to broaden the perspectives of new entrants to the software engineering research community and to provide constructive comments on the ongoing thesis research. </P>
<P>As the systems of doctoral courses are different by cultures, we are expecting participants coming from America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and all over the world. We plan to invite people from typical academic cultures to explain their doctoral systems so that we can compare and discuss differences between countries.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><B><P>HOW TO APPLY</B><FONT SIZE=4> </P>
</FONT><P>We are looking for students who are advanced enough to have a specific research proposal and some preliminary results, but with sufficient time remaining to thesis completion to benefit from the symposium experience. Application forms for describing the thesis topic and progress are available from the Symposium chair. A letter of recommendation from the student's thesis advisor is also required. The applications are reviewed by the committee, and acceptance and rejection will be notified. Students selected as participants will receive partial reimbursement for conference-related expenses.<FONT SIZE=4> </P>
