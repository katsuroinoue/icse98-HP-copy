Software Engineering in Organizations:<BR>
Lessons and Status Reports</h1>

<HR>

<P>Software Engineering in Organizations: Lessons and Status Reports are a new
element in the ICSE program.  The reports are intended to provide software
engineering professionals with a picture of interesting and innovative
software engineering work and research in the areas of software engineering
practices, procedures, techniques, products, and organizational structures.


<H2>Deadline</H2>

<b>16 September 1996</b><BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Our goal in presenting the Lessons and Status Reports is to provide software
engineers with:
<UL>
<LI>insights that can be adapted and applied within their own work and
    organization;
<LI>information on the activities of software engineering groups doing
    innovative and interesting work;
<LI>information on software engineering activities laying the basis for
    future generations of software engineering tools and practices.
</UL>

<P>We encourage submissions from institutions, organizations, and groups
within companies, universities, and government. For example, company
submissions are welcome from small product development teams in start-up
companies to SEPGs to established software groups in large companies.  We
also encourage submissions from the broadest range of applications, from
single-user PC software to global, enterprise-wide solutions.  We are
looking for lessons, procedures, techniques, approaches, products, and new
perspectives on old problems that stimulate practicing software engineers,
R&D organizations, and software engineering researchers, and which can be
learned and applied.

<P>We expect submissions that:
<UL>
<LI>present experience on some aspects of the application of innovative
    software engineering techniques in organizations;
<LI>report on the structure and status of software engineering activities
    and programs at an organization;
</UL>
though we also encourage submissions that do not fall into these two classes.

<P>The submissions should emphasize:
<UL>
<LI>the circumstances under which work is done,
<LI>the underlying goals, policies, and organizational background,
<LI>perspectives of past, present, and future software engineering efforts.
</UL>

<P>We aim to bring together people to report about their work with the focus
on giving the "big picture" rather than the technically interesting
spotlight on a singular scientific result.

<P>Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to make a 30 minute
presentation at the conference.

<H3>Example Submission</H3>

<P>We have included 
<a href="sample.html">a sample submission</a> to
illustrate what a good status report might contain. The submission
is an example of an experience report on the use of an innovative software
engineering technique.

<H2>Types of Organizations for Lessons and Status Reports</H2>

<P>Reports may describe software engineering work in:
<UL>
<LI>Product development or consultancy organizations
<LI>Corporate, university, or government research/advanced development
<LI>Software engineering process groups (SEPGs)
<LI>Groups or institutions
<LI>Countries or geographical region
<LI>Collaborative efforts involving several groups or organizations
<LI>Partnerships of different types of groups, or groups cooperating across
    geographical, political, or cultural boundaries
</UL>

<H2>Review Process</H2>

<P>Proposals will be reviewed for acceptance based on the interest to members
of the software engineering community and the objective of informing the
community of software engineering activities world wide.

<P>Proposals may also be solicited from organizations. Solicited proposals
will be subject to the same review process and criteria as proposals
submitted in response to this call.

<H2>Proposals</H2>

<P>Proposed Lessons and Status Reports must be prepared in the 
<a href="pubform">Conference Proceedings format</a>.  Proposals must not 
exceed two pages in length.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
November 1996.  Accepted reports  will be published in the ICSE 97
Conference Proceedings.

<P>The primary author of each accepted report will receive an Author Kit
with detailed instructions on how to submit camera-ready materials for
publication. These materials are due on 24 February 1997.

<H2>At the Conference</H2>

<P>At the conference, the Status Report should be presented by a major
participant in the work. The presentation should be based on the
material described in the Status Report summary. It should be
appropriate for a 30-minute verbal presentation that includes 5 minutes
for audience questions.

<H2>Ground Rules</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Your submission must be in English.
<LI>Electronic and fax submissions are not accepted.
<LI>Submissions which arrive after the deadline will not be considered.
<LI>Your submission should contain no proprietary or confidential material
    and should cite no proprietary or confidential publications.  Your
    submission should not be a demonstration of a commercial product.
<LI>Responsibility for permissions to use video, audio or pictures of
    identifiable people rests with you, not ICSE 97.
<LI>If your submission is accepted, it will not be published without copyright
    release forms signed by the first-listed author or a representative of the
    first author's institution.
<LI>We strongly suggest the use of express mail or a courier service, for
    speedy delivery. Customs labels should bear the words "Educational
    materials with no commercial value."
</OL>
