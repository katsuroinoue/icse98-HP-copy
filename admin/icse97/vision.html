Conference Vision</h1>

<P>The creation, deployment, evolution, and meaning of software and its role
in modern society is changing and expanding as a result of new
technologies, new applications, and new social factors.  The Internet, the
World-Wide-Web, multimedia interfaces, and neighborhood software stores
have added new dimensions to traditional issues and topics in software
engineering.  The International Conference on Software Engineering is
changing with the discipline to encompass the new emphases and the
broadened sweep of topics and concerns which confront today's software
professionals and researchers.

<P>The theme of the 1997 International Conference on Software Engineering is
"Pulling Together."  Pulling together denotes coordinated action of many
individuals in achieving a common goal.  It also describes the coming
together of many different perspectives, concerns, and abilities to find a
common ground and a way of achieving cooperation.  Pulling together is
fundamentally dynamic in nature, and is often a matter of explicit
negotiation and communication.  Major changes have been instituted in ICSE
97 to help the software engineering community pull together, in the full
sense of that phrase.

<P>ICSE 97 includes a widened range of conference activities, a widened range
of participants, and new technical areas.  A broadened outlook challenges
old beliefs, promotes new ideas and new synergies, and provides for a
dynamic, exciting program.  New or expanded conference activities include a
doctoral symposium, lessons and reports from software engineering
organizations, a mentor program, posters, and a commercial exhibit.

<P>A major addition to the conference is a suite of sessions and activities
focusing on the interests and needs of the practicing professional.
Numerous invited presentations, timely panel topics, experience reports,
and an expanded tutorial program are included.

<P>As the discipline expands, papers and presentations on topics such as
software engineering and the WWW, end-user involvement in software
development and customization, usability testing, design for an
international marketplace, and intelligent applications are encouraged.

<P>We hope that you will pull together with us, bringing new ideas, new
concerns, and new goals, thus helping us to find common ground and reach
new objectives.
