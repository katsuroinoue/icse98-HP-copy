<P>Research demonstrations enable conference participants to view research
systems in action and to discuss the systems with the people who created
them.  Research demonstrations are intended to show early implementations
of novel software engineering concepts.  Proposals will be evaluated on the
basis of their potential as demonstrations, their originality, and their
promise for bringing new and exciting ideas to the conference. We consider
any system which is at least six months away from appearing in a commercial
product as a "research system". Commercial systems will not be accepted as
research demonstrations.

<H2>Deadline</H2>

<b>1 November 1996</b><BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.

<H2>Types of Research Demonstrations</H2>

<H3>Formal Research Demonstrations</H3>

<P>Formal research demonstrations are for mature presentations that can be
communicated effectively in front of a large audience using projection
technology.  Formal research demonstrations will be scheduled into
40-minute blocks of time.  In addition to the formal demonstration, a booth
will be provided in the demonstration room to allow informal demonstrations
throughout the conference.  A 2-page description of each formal
demonstration will appear in the conference proceedings.

<H3>Informal Research Demonstrations</H3>

<P>Informal research demonstrations are appropriate for work that is very new, 
in a prototype stage, or otherwise not as fully developed as a formal
research demonstration.  Informal research demonstrations can also be used
by presenters who feel that their work may be more effectively presented to
a small audience.  A booth will be provided in the informal demonstration
room to allow ongoing demonstrations throughout the conference.  There will
be no description of informal demonstrations in the conference proceedings.

<H2>Review Process</H2>

<H3>Formal Demonstrations</H3>

<P>Submissions as formal research demonstrations will be reviewed
for both content and presentation by at least three reviewers.

<P>Acceptance criteria for formal demonstrations include:
<UL>
<LI>originality, significance, and relevance of the work;
<LI>maturity of the system as demonstrated by the script outline and
screen pictures;
<LI>quality of the demonstration, indicated by the script outline and
    screen pictures.
</UL>

<P>In addition, the number of demonstrations accepted may be limited by
space and time.

<H3>Informal Demonstrations</H3>

<P>Submissions as informal research demonstrations will be reviewed for
content only.

<P>Acceptance criteria for informal demonstrations include:
<UL>
<LI>originality, significance, and relevance of the work;
<LI>maturity of the system as demonstrated by the script outline and
      screen pictures.
</UL>

<P>In addition, the number of demonstrations accepted may be limited by
space.

<H2>Format</H2>

<H3>Formal Demonstrations</H3>

<P>Submitters of formal demonstrations should prepare a proposal for purposes
of review. The proposal should contain:
<UL>
<LI>a statement of why a demonstration is an appropriate way to present
    the work;
<LI>a description of the relevance of the work to the software engineering
community, emphasizing its novelty, uniqueness, and sound rationale;
<LI>a statement about the commercial status of the technology. (Commercial
products should be demonstrated in the exhibits area.);
<LI>a description of who the presenter is (developer, designer, etc.);
<LI>a detailed description of the necessary equipment support. Researchers
are strongly encouraged to bring their own computing equipment;
<LI>a two-page summary (see below);
<LI>a script outline (see below).
</UL>

<H3>Two-page Summary</H3>

<P>Submitters of formal demonstrations should prepare a two-page summary,
suitable for publication in the ICSE 97 proceedings. It must be prepared in
the <a href="pubform">Conference Proceedings format</a>.  Since this summary
will be read by many people who will not view the system, it must be
understandable without seeing the demonstration. It should contain
appropriate references to papers and computer implementations that are
closely related.

<H3>Script Outline</H3>

<P>Submitters of formal demonstrations must also include a script outline
which will be used to review the submission. The script outline should
include at least the most important screen pictures. The outline should
begin with a statement of the problem and the proposed solution, and how it
addresses the problem. It is recommended that presenters refer to the
screen pictures liberally throughout the text. Presenters should also refer
to related work in the field, specifically to other implementations of
similar ideas.

<H3>Informal Demonstrations</H3>

<P>Submitters of informal demonstrations should prepare a proposal for
purposes of review. The proposal should contain:
<UL>
<LI>a statement of why a demonstration is an appropriate way to present
    the work;
<LI>a description of the relevance of the work to the software
    engineering community, emphasizing its novelty, uniqueness, and
    sound rationale;
<LI>a statement about the commercial status of the technology;
<LI>a description of who the presenter is (developer, designer;
    etc.);
<LI>a detailed description of the necessary equipment support.
    Researchers are strongly encouraged to bring their own computing
    equipment.
</UL>

<H2>Computing and Projection Equipment</H2>

<P>Researchers doing demonstrations are expected to provide their own
computing equipment, cables, and power cords whenever possible.  Foreign
researchers should remember to bring converters to 110V AC.  If it will be
impossible for you to bring your own equipment, you should provide a list
of the equipment you would like the conference to provide.  The conference
might be able to provide a limited number of monitors and keyboards.  The
conference will not provide CPUs or disk drives as the likelihood of
incompatibility with the software being demonstrated is very high.  If you
request equipment, acceptance of your demonstration will be contingent upon
availability of the hardware.

<P>The conference will provide projection technology to be used in the formal
demonstrations.  More details about the specific projection technology will
be provided to those with accepted formal demonstrations.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of December
1996.

<P>The primary author of each accepted formal demonstration will receive an
Author Kit with detailed instructions on how to submit camera-ready
materials for publication. These materials are due on 24 February 1997.

<H2>At the Conference</H2>

<P>Formal and informal research demonstrations will be held in rooms 
dedicated to this activity throughout the conference.  Formal research 
demonstrations will occur at scheduled times during the conference. Informal
demonstrations will be ongoing; researchers are expected to be available
throughout the conference.

<OL>
<LI>Your submission must be in English.
<LI>Electronic and fax submissions are not accepted.
