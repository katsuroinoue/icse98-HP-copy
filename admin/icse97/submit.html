<P>The annual International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) is 
the leading forum for the exchange of ideas on all aspects of software 
engineering. ICSE 97 invites you to submit work to share with the 
ICSE community.

<P>Different classes of contributions are sought, ranging from
research papers to lessons and status reports from software
engineering organizations.  The ultimate goal is to build a rich and
comprehensive conference program that can fit the interests and needs
of different classes of attendees: professionals, researchers,
managers, and students.

<H3>Choosing a Participation Category</H3>

If you are unsure of which category to submit to, please consult the
Program Coordinators or the Co-chairs in charge of specific events you
may be interested in.

<H3>Multiple and Related Submissions</H3>

You may prepare as many submissions as you like in the same or different
categories. In a given category, materials should be presented only once.


<H3>Reaching the Entire Software Engineering Community</H3>

ICSE 97 encourages participation from the entire Software Engineering 
community in the following ways:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="committee.html#International">International Relations
Co-Chairs</A> represent ICSE communities from America, Asia,
Australia, and Europe and may be contacted to obtain more information
on any aspect of participation in the Conference.

<LI>Conference committees are composed of individuals from a variety
of countries and disciplines.

<LI><A HREF="#Mentoring">Mentoring</A> is available

<LI>Guides to successful submission and answers to frequently asked
questions are available. Please see individual submission categories for
details on where to find this information.

<LI>For the Technical Program, the technical merit of submissions is more
important than the quality of the English used in the submission. However,
the quality of English may be a key determinant in a paper's acceptance:
the better your English is, the more readily your ideas communicate.
Submitters are encouraged to find a native speaker of English to help edit
the submission or ask for an ICSE mentor.
</UL>

<H3>Topic Areas</H3>
ICSE 97 encourages submissions from the many perspectives that contribute
to the whole of Software Engineering.  We particularly encourage papers
addressing topics wherein software engineering issues play a key role, but
where those topics have not been highlighted in previous ICSEs.  We
encourage discussions of both the process and outcome of research, design,
engineering, development, installation, use, and maintenance.  Examples
include:

<H3>Language of the Conference</H3>

In keeping with the international character of ICSE 97, the written and
spoken language of the conference is English.

<H3>Quality</H3>

For an ICSE submission to be accepted you must say something 
significant. All submissions should address the following:

<P>Content
<UL>
<LI>State your message clearly.
<LI>What methods did you use and why?
<LI>What are your findings or what are the issues? Be specific regarding the 
    status of any software systems discussed.
<LI>Review the literature carefully. Please read and cite relevant
    material from previous ICSE Proceedings, journals, and other
    conference proceedings.  
<LI>Identify the innovative aspects of your work clearly.
</UL>

<P>Consequences
<UL>
<LI>What should the audience do differently if and when they have
    accepted your message?
<LI>What are the directions for future work based on your work?
</UL>

<H3>Review Process</H3>

<P>All submissions will be reviewed by the technical area Co-Chairs and their
committees. Submissions will be evaluated according to accepted ICSE
standards of excellence. If you have questions about these standards,
please see information in the individual submission categories, retrieve
the additional electronic documents mentioned there, or contact one of the
Co-Chairs.

<P>If you need further help, please request an 
<A HREF="#Mentoring">ICSE mentor</A>.


<H3>Publication: Conference Proceedings</H3>

Accepted papers and other material (see details in the various
participation categories) will be published in the ICSE 97 Conference
Proceedings. The Proceedings is a citable archival source: it will have an
ISBN number and will be available for sale through the ACM and the IEEE
Computer Society.

<H3><A NAME="Mentoring">ICSE Mentoring</A></H3>  

<P> Every year ICSE submissions from people unfamiliar with the ICSE community
are rejected because authors do not understand the expectations for an ICSE
submission. We are consequently missing many interesting viewpoints.  If
you are not familiar with how to write a good ICSE submission, please ask
for a mentor.  A mentor is a person who helps you learn something
unfamiliar through a personal one-on-one relationship. Ask for a mentor by
contacting one of the Program Coordinators through electronic mail, fax, or
phone.

<P>If you want to ask for a mentor we will need to hear from you no later than
10 weeks prior to the submission deadline for the chosen category.  We
highly recommend that you request a mentor even earlier.

<P>You may need a mentor to help you choose a submission category, or to help
you figure out how to prepare your submission, or both. The mentor does not
prepare the submission for you but helps you do a better job of it
yourself. The mentor addresses questions such as, but not limited to:

<UL>
<LI>Are the issues addressed relevant to the ICSE community?  How
    could the work be made more relevant?
<LI>Is the work adequately related to and differentiated from
    other relevant work that ICSE community members are likely to be
    familiar with?
<LI>Is the information given about methodology and results at
    the right level of detail and rigor for an ICSE audience?
</UL>

<P>We expect mentoring will be most useful for participants that have not
traditionally contributed
to ICSE (e.g., from a particular application domain).  However, mentoring
is available to any submitter on a first come, first serve basis.  Please
note that there are no guarantees that participating in this program will
ensure that your submission will be accepted by the review committee. The
mentoring process is completely independent of the review process.

<P>The mentor does not become a co-author. The mentor need not appear in the
acknowledgments of an accepted submission, as mentoring is a private matter
between mentor and submitter. In the Proceedings, we will have a page
listing those who mentored to acknowledge their contribution, but
acknowledgment is completely separate from an individual submission.

<P>We have limited resources (volunteers) available, so mentors will be
assigned on a first come, first served basis. Act early, since the feedback
given by the mentor may suggest extensive modifications to the submission,
which cannot easily be done at the last minute. Mentoring is available to
submitters in all participation categories covered in this Call for
Participation.
