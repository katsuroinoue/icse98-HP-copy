<H2>Workshop Focus:</H2>

<P>Traditional work on inconsistency in Requirements Engineering has viewed
consistency as a virtue and inconsistency as a bug. The notion of an 
inconsistent
specification has generated methods and models for detecting and removing
inconsistency as early as possible. In this workshop, we take a broader
view. We are interested in the Requirements Engineering of systems that
may need to, or may even want to <I>live with inconsistency</I>. There are
three key sources of such inconsistency that we wish to consider at the
workshop:</P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Viewpoint inconsistency</I> brought about by multiple stakeholders
with differing requirements. If these are not completely resolved at design
time, how should the resulting system handle such inconsistencies if and
when they arise at run time?</LI>

<LI><I>Process enactment inconsistency</I> brought about by a mismatch
between a software process model and its enactment in the real world.</LI>

<LI><I>Runtime inconsistency</I> brought about by inconsistent views of
the environment. Causes can be either an inaccurate modeling of the environment
during the RE process, or by an environment that changes once a system
is in place. </LI>
</UL>

<P>We believe that, for a large number of systems, each of these three
types of inconsistency will be inevitable and impossible to avoid. Instead,
mechanisms must be devised to live with them and mitigate their negative
impact. We are particularly interested in bridging the largest gap of all,
that between requirements time reasoning, and run-time actions.</P>

<P>The research areas that arise out of our view of inconsistency are as
follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Designing for inconsistency</I> - e.g., languages for capturing
differing viewpoints, languages for capturing process enactment inconsistency,
languages for stating breakable environmental assumptions.</LI>

<LI><I>Detecting inconsistency</I> - e.g., monitoring for inconsistent
requirements among a group of stakeholders, monitoring for enactment-time
process inconsistencies, monitoring for run-time requirements failures.</LI>

<LI><I>Responding to inconsistency</I> - e.g., negotiating among stakeholders
to form a consistent set of requirements, dynamically recasting a process
model to reflect inconsistent enactment, redesigning a system (possibly
<i>in situ</i>) to meet a new set of environment needs.</LI>

<li><i>Cost/benefit analysis</i> - what effort should be put into finding
and removing inconsistencies prior to enactment/production versus the effort
of handling inconsistencies on the fly when (if ever) they arise in the enacted
process or delivered system?
</UL>

<H2>Workshop Format &amp;&nbsp;Submission</H2>

<P>We plan an intensive 1-day workshop. To encourage interaction, there
will be maximum of 20 participants. </P>

<P>We encourage those with an interest in any of these research areas to
submit a short position paper by <B>Monday March
17th 1997 (<FONT COLOR="#008000">St Patrick's Day</FONT>)</B> to
Fickas (address below). Electronic submission, in the form of a plain text
or postscript file, preferred.</P>
