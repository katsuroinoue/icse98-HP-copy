<P>Posters provide an excellent opportunity to show late-breaking results and
ongoing work or finished results during the conference.  Note that not all
types of work in software engineering can be presented effectively using
posters during the conference. Prospective submitters should carefully
consider how their work may be presented.

<H2>Deadline</H2>

<b>15 February 1997</b><BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) PST.

<H2>Review Process</H2>

<P>Submissions will be reviewed by a panel of experts in the field using the
standard ICSE criteria: originality, importance and generality of
contribution, soundness of rationale or demonstration, quality of written
and graphic presentation, and appropriate citation of relevant literature.

<H2>Format</H2>

<P>Authors should prepare a four page description of their poster for review.
The description should provide:  (a) a summary of the technical content of
the poster and (b) a description of how the material will be presented on
the poster.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
March 1997.

<H2>At the Conference</H2>

<P>Posters will have display space (approximately 2.5 m by 1.2 m), with a
table for other materials, optionally including an informal demonstration
and/or videotape.  Author(s) will be expected to be present at scheduled
times for informal discussions at their posters.  (The conference will not
provide any electronic equipment for demonstration or presentation of
cd-rom or videotapes;  use and security of such equipment is fully the
authors' responsibility.)

<H2>Ground Rules</H2>

<OL>
<LI>The poster should effectively communicate the material without the presence
of the author, as posters will remain posted throughout the entire
conference.  Dedicated interactive poster sessions, where presenters will
be available at their posters to discuss the work and answer questions will
be scheduled during conference breaks and other appropriate times.
<LI>Your submission must be in English.
<LI>Electronic and fax submissions are not accepted.
<LI>Submissions which arrive after the deadline will not be considered.
<LI>Your submission should contain no proprietary or confidential material
    and should cite no proprietary or confidential publications.  Your
    submission should not be a demonstration of a commercial product.
<LI>Responsibility for permissions to use video, audio or pictures of
    identifiable people rests with you, not ICSE 97.
<LI>If your submission is accepted, it will not be published without copyright
    release forms signed by the first-listed author or a representative of the
    first author's institution.
<LI>We strongly suggest the use of express mail or a courier service, for
    speedy delivery. Customs labels should bear the words "Educational
    materials with no commercial value."
