<P>The aim of the ICSE 97 panels is to stimulate discussion about ideas and
issues of crucial importance to the software engineering community. Panels
may emphasize complex technical issues, but they may equally provide an
opportunity to propose views and address controversies through the medium
of informed debate. Suitable topics for such discussion include pressing
issues in software engineering theory and practice, emerging industry
trends and enabling technologies, and professional, organizational, and
social issues associated with software engineering.

<P>A panel is an interactive discussion. It is essential for the moderator and
panelists to design it in advance, for them to prepare fully, and for the
moderator to exercise control over the discussion. Too many promising
panels turn out to be dreary paper sessions in disguise. We want the panels
at ICSE 97 to stick (positively) in people's minds.


<H2>Deadline</H2>

<b>2 August 1996</b>.

<H2>Types of Panels</H2>

<P>Panels last 90 minutes and can be organized in many formats. Several
suggestions are provided below. However, we strongly encourage proposals in
original formats that will engage the panelists and audience in a lively
and substantive discussion.

<H3>Analytic Panels</H3>

<P>An analytic panel analyzes and synthesizes current practices in the various
fields of software engineering. The panelists aim at introducing the
audience to new ideas and should therefore be technical experts selected
from distinct fields but addressing a single problem. Panelists should
address the following questions:

<UL>
<LI>How do their topic areas complement each other?
<LI>How do we reconcile vocabulary, concepts and notations?
<LI>How can their research results be transferred effectively to
    industrial practice, and, conversely, how can industrial needs be
    recognized and addressed by the research community?
</UL>

<P>The biggest challenge in an analytic panel is to ensure it does not
deteriorate into a paper session. It is therefore essential that
panelists' ideas are explicitly interrelated and synthesized.

<H3>Comparative Panels</H3>

<P>In a comparative panel, panelists compare distinct approaches, techniques
and models to a particular problem. Panelists should explain why their
approach is better than everyone else's (and not merely assert that it is).
The panel should aim at identifying the common philosophy among the
approaches represented in the panel, and on what crucial distinctions (as
opposed to accidental details) their differences depend. A comparative
panel should be controversial, but the panelists should treat each other's
approaches with respect. Panelists should be technical experts within the
same field.

<P>The biggest challenge with a comparative panel is to ensure that the
panelists understand and respect each other's approaches and do not see the
panel as an opportunity for a sales job. One technique is to have each
panelist present "someone else's" approach as positively as possible.

<H3>Exercises</H3>

<P>In an exercise, the aim is to have panelists solve a small but
representative problem, using their chosen approach and with little
preparation. In suitable circumstances, the problem scenario could be
revealed to the panelists at the start of the session itself. The problem
scenario will be selected in advance by the moderator of the session.

<P>The biggest challenges with an exercise are to ensure that the panelists
are prepared and that the audience goes away seeing the forest, not just
the trees. For an excercise panel to achieve any closure, it is essential
that the moderator be able to summarize at the end of the session the key
similarities and differences among the panelists' approaches.

<H3>Predictive Panels</H3>

<P>In a predictive panel, panelists from different fields discuss the ways in
which emerging techniques and technologies will affect the practice of
software engineering in the future. Panelists should be experts in their
relevant fields and should have clear ideas about how work in their fields
is influencing the future.

<P>The challenge with a predictive panel is to avoid idle speculation and
waffling. The key idea is careful selection of the topic and panelists.

<H2>Topics</H2>

<P>Panels may address any topic of relevance to software engineering research
and practice. Panels are an opportunity to stimulate thinking about how
software engineering is evolving. This means that topics need not be
limited to the conventional boundaries of the field.

<H2>Review Process</H2>

<P>Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the panel committee, who
will consist of academics and practitioners. We are looking for stimulating
and timely proposals that will be debated by well-informed and engaging
panelists and that will form a diverse, controversial, and well thought out
collection.  Please feel free to contact either panel co-chair in advance
to discuss your proposal.


<P>Our criteria will include:

<UL>
<LI>Clear emphasis on a well-defined topic, and the positions that the
    panelists are likely to take;
<LI>Relevance of the proposed topic to software engineering research or
    practice;
<LI>Likelihood of debate and controversy;
<LI>Demonstrated expertise of the panelists;
<LI>Evidence of fresh thinking in the panel format.
</UL>

<P>In summary, we will ask ourselves whether the average audience member
will go away from the panel with new and valuable ideas.

<H2>Format</H2>

<H3>Proposal</H3>

<P>A proposal should contain the following:

<UL>
<LI>A <em>one-page</em> description of the topic, stating compelling issues
    to be debated, and their relevance to software engineering.

<LI>A <em>one-page</em> description of the panel format (not limited to those
    specified above), stating how the panel will be conducted and why the
    proposed format is suitable for the given topic.

<LI>A <em>one-page</em> summary of the organizer(s) and all the panelists,
    including names, affiliations, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses.
    Panelists must have agreed to be members of the panel.

<LI>A <em>half-page</em> position paper from EACH panelist, summarizing his or
    her view about the topic, the issues it raises, and their qualifications to
    address the topic.
</UL>

<H3>Conference Proceedings Summary</H3>

<P>A summary of each panel will appear in the conference proceedings. The
panel organizer is required to collate the half-page position papers (or
later revisions of them), together with an introduction into a summary
description of the panel. Panelists must agree to the half-page position
papers being published in the conference proceedings.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
November 1996.

<P>Summaries of accepted panels will be published on the World Wide Web in the
pre-conference publicity. Panel organizers will be sent an author kit for
preparing camera-ready or electronic materials ready for publication. These
materials are due 24 Feburary 1997.

<P>Panel organizers are expected to help panelists prepare for
participation and coordinate the contributions of the panel.
