<P>Papers describe innovative and significant work in the research and
practice of Software Engineering. Papers are collected in an archival,
refereed conference proceedings, published by ACM/IEEE, which is cited and
read by researchers and practitioners world-wide. Accepted papers are
presented at the ICSE conference, attended by hundreds of people. Having a
paper on the technical program gives authors an opportunity to have a
tremendous impact on the study and application of Software Engineering
principles, theory, and techniques.

<P>Paper submissions to ICSE are reviewed rigorously by the 
<a href="committee.html#Program">Program Committee</a>,
who are volunteers drawn from the international technical community of
Software Engineering researchers and professionals. Because there is no
revision cycle, the content and presentation of submitted papers must be
essentially acceptable as received.

<H2>Deadline</H2>

<P>Abstract in electronic format (ASCII email): <b>2 August 1996</b>.<BR>
Full paper due (6 copies, hard copy only): <b>9 August 1996</b>.<BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.

<H2>Types of Papers</H2>

<P>The Software Engineering community consists of researchers and
professionals from many different disciplines and intellectual traditions.
The paper review process tries to rigorously review all submissions in a
manner that takes into account the different criteria from different parts
of the community. For reviewers to do this effectively, they need an
accurate assessment of the type of each paper they read.  Please select a
type of paper from the following list that best describes your submission
and write it in the appropriate place on the Cover Page.  If you feel that
your submission does not fit any of these types, or if it seems to match
more than one type description, please contact a Papers Co-Chair for help
in best classifying your submission.

<P>The three primary categories of papers are grouped into sets that will be
published and identified separately in the conference proceedings.

<H3>Research Contributions</H3>

<DL>
<DT>Theory Papers:
<DD>Theory Papers describe principles, concepts, or models on
which work in Software Engineering might be based; authors of theoretical
papers are expected to position their ideas within a broad context of
Software Engineering frameworks and theories.  Review criteria include the
originality and soundness of the analysis provided, as well as the
relevance of the theoretical content to Software Engineering practice
and/or research.

<DT>Systems Papers:
<DD>Systems Papers describe novel technology for any aspect of
software engineering.  Review criteria include the originality and
relevance of the system's architecture and behavior with respect to the
existing state-of-the-art.  Authors should be clear to what extent the
system has been implemented and applied in practical circumstances.

<DT>Empirical Papers:
<DD>Empirical Papers describe the collection and
interpretation of data concerning the use of software engineering methods,
techniques, and tools.  Data might include interviews, observations,
surveys, or experimental manipulations.  Both qualitative and quantitative
approaches to data collection and analysis are welcome. Review criteria
include the appropriateness and rationale for the methods of data
collection and analysis, and the significance of the conclusions for
practice or research in Software Engineering.
</DL>

<H3>Experience Reports</H3>

<P>Experience Papers describe the application of software engineering methods,
theory or tools to the development of significant software products.
Review criteria include the value of the reflections abstracted from the
experience and their relevance to other designers or to researchers working
on related methods, theory or tools.

<H3>Opinion Papers</H3>

<P>Opinion papers present the author's well-supported opinion about some
aspect of Software Engineering.  Review criteria include the impact and
quality of the argumentation, including the experience (research or
practice) used to support the opinion.  Authors of opinion papers are urged
to contact one of the Papers Co-Chairs in advance of submitting a paper, to
get feedback on their idea, since ICSE rarely accepts opinion papers.


<H2>Review Process</H2>

<P>Each submitted paper will be reviewed by a group of at least three members
of the program committee.  Reviewer assignment will be done by matching the
topic and focus of the paper with committee member expertise.   The
committee members will develop a summary review and recommendation for
acceptance or rejection. Final decisions will be made at a program
committee meeting, where the committee as a whole will review the
recommendations and rationale made by committee members.

<P>Note that in addition to considering the criteria outlined for each type of
paper, all papers will be evaluated for overall quality of presentation:
the problem and its context must be clearly described, including relation
to prior work. It must also be clear from the presentation that a succinct
(25-minute), high quality verbal presentation at the conference will be
possible.


<H2>How to Submit</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Electronic Submission of Title and Abstract (Required):
<DD>In addition to their appearance in the full, printed paper, the title
and abstract of every submission must also be transmitted by email
to <a href="mailto:icse-97-papers@ics.uci.edu">icse-97-papers@ics.uci.edu</a>
by the deadline for abstracts shown above.
The abstract must be plain text only (ASCII) - no markup languages,
no binhex, no binary files.

<DT>Submission of Full Papers:
<DD>Submitted papers must appear in the 
<a href="pubform">standard Conference Proceedings format</a>  Papers may be no longer
than 11 pages in the Conference Proceedings format, including references,
appendices and figures. The full papers may not be submitted
electronically;  paper copies are required.
</DL>

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of November
1996.

<P>Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 97 Conference Proceedings.
The primary author of each accepted paper will receive an Author Kit
with detailed instructions on how to submit the camera-ready copy.
These materials are due on 24 February 1997.
