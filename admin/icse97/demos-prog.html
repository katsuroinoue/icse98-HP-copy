Research demonstrations enable conference participants to view research
systems in actions and to discuss the systems with the people who
created them. Research demonstrations are intended to show early
implementations of novel software engineering concepts. Demonstrations
have been selected on the basis of their potential as demonstrations,
their originality, and their promise for bringing new and exciting ideas
to the conference. We consider any system which is at least six months
away from appearing in a commercial product as a Rresearch system.S
Commercial systems are not accepted as research demonstrations.

<P>
<B>Formal Research Demonstrations</b> will be given as part of the technical
track.
<P>
<B>Informal Research Demonstrations</b> will be given by research groups from a
number of universities and industrial laboratories in a special
exhibition area.
