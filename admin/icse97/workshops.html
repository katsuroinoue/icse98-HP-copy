Workshops</h1>

Workshops Co-Chairs:<BR>
<b>Reino Kurki-Suonio</b>, Tampere University of Technology, Finland<BR>
<b>Lawrence G. Votta</b>, AT&T Laboratories
<HR>

<P>Workshops provide an opportunity for a group of participants to exchange
ideas on a topic, either research or applied. Workshops are held before the
formal conference and may be one, one and a half, or two days in length.
Workshops can be a valuable forum for exchange of ideas among individuals
with different perspectives on a topic. Workshops are not alternative
forums for full papers which otherwise could be submitted to ICSE.
Participation in workshops is typically dependent on submission of position
statements.

<H2>Deadline</H2>
Proposal due (7 copies, hard copy only): <b>15 June 1996</b><BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.

<H2>Review Process</H2>

<P>Workshop proposals will be reviewed by a committee representing a
cross-section of Software Engineering researchers and professionals.
Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the workshop's potential for
generating useful results, the timeliness and expected interest level in
the topic, and the organizer's ability to lead a successful workshop.

<H2>Format</H2>

<P>You should prepare a proposal which will be used in the review process, a
summary to be published in the ICSE 97 Conference Proceedings if the
rkshop is accepted, and a Call for Participation.

<H3>Proposal</H3>

<P>Prepare a three-page proposal for the workshop review
committee.  Workshop proposals should contain:

<UL>
<LI>an outline of the theme and goals of the workshop and its relevance
    to the field;
<LI>a description of the desired number of participants, the participant
solicitation and selection process, pre-workshop activities, and planned
workshop activities, including length of time;
<LI> a brief description of each organizer's background, including relevant
past experience with workshops, and whether the organizers  have organized
ICSE workshops before.
</UL>

<P>Feel free to discuss your ideas with the Co-Chairs before submitting.

<H2>Publication</H2>

<h3>Conference Proceedings Summary</h3>

<P>Prepare a one-page summary of the workshop, suitable for publication in the
ICSE 97 Conference Proceedings. The summary should contain the title,
organizer's name, organizer contact information, keywords, and a summary of
the issues and goals of the workshop.  This summary must be prepared in the
Conference Proceedings Format (pages 13-14), except that no abstract is
required.

<h3>Call for Participation</h3>

<P>Prepare a  250-word Call for Participation describing the workshop and the
participant selection process.  The Call will be disseminated
electronically, published in the ACM SIGSOFT and IEEE TCSE Newsletters, and
the ICSE 97 Advance Program, if the workshop is accepted.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Organizers will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
May 1996.

<P>Summaries of accepted workshops will be published in the ICSE 97
Conference Proceedings.

<P>The organizer is responsible for:

<UL>
<LI> soliciting diverse participation in the workshop by disseminating the
Call for Participation to appropriate mailing lists and other settings;

<LI>receiving requests for participation in the form of position or
    participation statements;

<LI>selecting and inviting participants;

<LI>distributing statements to all participants in advance.  The
    statements provide participants with background and a chance to
    interact before the event;

<LI>developing an agenda in advance of the event and outlining planned
    workshop activities and their durations.
</UL>

<P>Production of a proceedings for the workshop, if desired, will be
the complete responsibility of the workshop organizer.  ICSE 97 maybe 
able to assist with this, however.  Interested parties should contact
the Workshops Coordinators for more information.

<H2>At the Workshop</H2>

<P>The organizer is responsible for facilitating discussion by helping to
establish and maintain a productive interaction and encouraging
participation.  In workshops, the emphasis is typically on group discussion
of a topic rather than presentations of individuals' positions with
follow-up questions.  Diversity of perspectives should be encouraged.

<P>ICSE 97 will provide meeting rooms, coffee breaks, and audio-visual support
for workshops.  Workshop participants, including organizers, will be
charged a fee to cover this support.  If a proceedings is produced, its
costs must also be covered by the registration fee.

<H2>After the Workshop</H2>

<P>It is important for the results of a workshop to be communicated to a
larger audience.  This can be accomplished in a number of ways, such as by
holding a Special Interest Group meeting at the conference.  In any case,
workshops are expected to produce a poster describing the workshop for the
ICSE 97 poster session, and a report on the workshop for publication in
Software Engineering Notes.
