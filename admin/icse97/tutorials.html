<HR>

<P>The ICSE 97 Tutorials program provides conference participants with the
opportunity to gain new insights, knowledge, and skills in a broad range of
areas in the field of software engineering. Tutorial topics are expected to
cover a wide range, from practical guidelines, standards, and surveys to
academic and theoretical issues.  The topics are not limited to past ICSE
Tutorial offerings. Participants at tutorials include software
professionals (developers, designers, testers, analysts, and managers),
teachers and researchers in software engineering, and professionals in
other areas seeking to gain a better understanding of how to apply software
engineering technologies to their specialties.

<H2>Deadline</H2>

<b>2 August 1996</b><BR>
5:00 p.m. (17:00) local time at receiving address.


<H2>Topics</H2>

<P>Tutorials are intended to cover a wide range of topics. In the past they
have included introductions and overviews of software engineering methods
and processes, techniques for specific phases of the process, new
methodologies, formal approaches, theoretical issues, different application
areas, assessment approaches and techniques, requirements analysis
techniques, design methodologies, user interface development software,
multimedia, computer supported cooperative work and groupware,
participatory design, teaching software engineering, software
documentation, cost/benefit analysis, legal issues, and standards.
Tutorials on these and other topics broadly related to software engineering
are solicited. To broaden the scope of ICSE tutorials, topics of current
interest to professionals (e.g. WWW authoring, Java applications, C++,
CORBA, Windows NT) are especially encouraged.

<H2>Types of Tutorials: Duration and Audience Experience Level</H2>

<P>There will be tutorials of different durations, different scopes, and
for different experience levels.

<H3>Duration</H3>

<P>Each tutorial is designed to be a half day or a full day in duration.
Half-day
tutorials are 3 hours long (not including breaks). Full-day tutorials are 6
hours long (not including breaks).

<H3>Scope</H3>

<P>Tutorials will range in scope from survey of many topics to in-depth
study of one or a few topics.

<H3>Audience experience levels</H3>

<P>Each tutorial is designed for one of three audience experience levels:

<DL>
<dt>Introductory:
<dd>Introductory level tutorials cover fundamental software engineering
concepts,
principles and techniques. Little previous background or knowledge is assumed.

<dt>Intermediate:
<dd>Intermediate level tutorials give deeper and more thorough treatment
of a selected topic area. Some general background in one or more
software engineering disciplines is assumed, but background in the
topic area is not required.

<dt>Advanced:
<dd>Advanced level tutorials cover emerging developments from software
engineering research or detailed treatment of a specific
area. Background in the topic area is assumed.
</DL>

<H2>Review Process</H2>

<P>Tutorial proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their estimated
benefit for prospective participants and on their fit within the tutorials
program as a whole. Factors to be considered include: relevance,
timeliness, importance, and audience appeal; suitability for presentation
in a half-day or full-day tutorial format; use of presentation methods that
offer participants direct experience with the material being taught; and
past experience and qualifications of the instructors. Selection is also
based on the overall distribution of topics, approaches (overview, theory,
methodology, how-to), audience experience levels, and specialties of the
intended audiences. Thus, not all tutorials of technical merit can be
accommodated within the tutorials program.

<H2>Format</H2>

<P>Submissions for ICSE 97 tutorials must include the following four documents:

<UL>
<LI>Proposal
<LI>Conference Proceedings Summary
<LI>Advance Program Description
<LI>Requirements List
</UL>

<H3>Proposal</H3>

<P>Prepare a proposal, no longer than 10 pages, for review purposes. The
proposal should be a clearly written specification of the tutorial. It
should:

<UL>
<LI>Describe in detail the material that will be covered in the course.
<LI>Justify the tutorial for an ICSE audience.
<LI>Explain how the tutorial will be conducted.
<LI>give a schedule of events with time allocations.
<LI>Describe and provide samples of materials that will be included in the
      tutorial notes.
</UL>

<P>If the proposed tutorial has been given previously, the proposal should
include a brief history of where the tutorial has been given and how it
will be modified for ICSE 97. In addition, if the tutorial has been given
at a previous ICSE, the proposal should tell how changes to the tutorial
will address comments from previous attendees.

<H3>Conference Proceedings Summary</H3>

<P>Prepare a two-page summary suitable for publication in the ICSE 97
Conference Proceedings. The summary should provide a descriptive statement
of the content of the tutorial. It must be in the Conference Proceedings
format, and must contain the title, authors, contact information, keywords,
abstract, body, and references.

<H3>Advance Program Description</H3>

<P>Prepare a description of the tutorial suitable for inclusion in the ICSE 97
Advance Program. It should guide potential participants in deciding whether
to take the tutorial. The description should consist of four paragraphs, as
follows:

<UL>
<LI>The content, duration (half day or full day), and scope  (survey or
in-depth) of the course.
<LI>The key learning objectives for the participants (what specific 
knowledge each participant is expected to obtain).
<LI>The intended audience of the tutorial (their specialties and experience
level, plus any prior knowledge they will be assumed to have).
<LI>The background of each instructor.
</UL>

<H3>Requirements List</H3>

<P>Prepare a list of requirements for running the tutorial. Include any
supplies required for each participant, restrictions or conditions on
offering the tutorial, and other information that the review committee
should know in considering the proposal.

<H2>Upon Acceptance</H2>

<P>Instructors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
November 1996.  Acceptance is conditional upon the instructors' compliance
with deadlines and requirements.

<P>Summaries of accepted tutorials will be published in the ICSE 97 Proceedings.

<P>The primary instructor of each accepted tutorial will receive an Author Kit
with detailed instructions on how to submit camera-ready and electronic
materials for publication. These materials are due on 24 February 1997.

<P>Instructors of accepted tutorials will also receive detailed format
requirements for preparation of camera-ready versions of their tutorial
notes. The notes are also due on 24 February 1997.

<P>Instructors should prepare course material specifically for the
ICSE 97 tutorial session. Presentation materials used by the instructor for
other courses or projects must be reworked within the guidelines described
in the Author Kit.

<H2>Tutorial Notes</H2>

<P>Attendees at previous ICSEs have indicated that the tutorial notes are a
valuable benefit of taking a tutorial. Consequently, proposed tutorials are
accepted contingent upon receipt of high-quality tutorial notes. The notes
should serve as reference materials for attendees and should support the
presentation of material during the tutorial. The tutorial notes should
include:

<UL>
<LI>an introduction to the topic;
<LI>copies of all overhead transparencies and slides;
<LI>an annotated bibliography;
<LI>copies of relevant background material or scholarly papers (for
    which the instructors have obtained any necessary reprint permission);
<LI>tutorial exercises, as appropriate.
</UL>

<P>Instructors must sign a release form giving ICSE 97 one-time only
permission to utilize the notes for tutorial participants and to dispose of
any surplus notes at the conference.
