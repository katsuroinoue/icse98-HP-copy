<h1>Applying Design Pattern Ideas in the Transition of a Development 
Organization</h1>

<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
This organization overview describes a project to re-engineer a 
company's information systems from mainframe, COBOL systems 
to systems written in Smalltalk. We describe how design pattern 
ideas were used to facilitate the team's adoption of OO ideas, and 
their development of the applications. We list some observations 
on this approach.

<H2>Context</H2>
A large, offshore company was under strong competitive and 
customer pressure to make its information systems more flexible 
and responsive to changing business needs. The current systems 
were mainframe-based, written in COBOL. The IS organization 
had a fairly rigid, hierarchical organization, low morale, very 
high turnover (greater than 100% per year), a poor record on 
delivery of new applications, and little respect from the business 
divisions of the company.

<H2>Focus</H2>
The company decided to launch a project to re-build its entire IS 
systems. The project was to be based in the US, using some of the 
existing developers augmented by new, experienced personnel. 
The project leader decide to implement the new systems in 
Smalltalk.

In addition to learning the syntactic and semantic aspects of the 
language, the team faced the problem of developing practices and 
models to form a culture of use of the language.

<H2>Approach</H2>
The project team started at X people, and grew to 40 people. The 
development team was trained in the language. At this point team 
members were able to write small programs, but were not able to 
address large applications. This, together with the team's 
background in the IS organization, resulted in a lack of 
confidence in their ability to achieve the re-implementation which 
was the goal of the project.
<P>
The project manager initiated a series of workshops to maintain 
and continue the team's training. An early (three day) workshop 
in this series tackled the entire development of an application, 
from beginning to end. This workshop proved to be a turning 
point for the team. Their previous context of a hierarchical 
organization meant that they had no clear picture of the complete 
development process, and they were not responsible for the results 
of the entire process. The workshop showed them all of the steps, 
and showed them a development process which made them 
responsible for their work. The team's confidence level increased 
dramatically.
<P>
The increase in confidence did not resolve one of the major issues 
facing the team, that of tackling the design of the systems they 
were to implement.

<H2>Design Patterns</H2>
There has been a recent spate of interest in architectural patterns 
for software systems. In the context of object-oriented design of 
systems, these architectural models are expressed as object classes 
and relationships that address common design problems. A recent 
book by Gamma et al [1] presents more than twenty such patterns 
for common design problems.
<P>
The project leader decided to use design patterns as a way of 
extending the team's training beyond the Smalltalk language into 
the design of the applications. A catalog of patterns was prepared 
(and refined during the project). The patterns were taught to the 
team who began to use them.
<P>
Several effects were observed. The first is that the design pattern 
catalog became a daily tool used by developers. A cheat sheet of 
the catalog appeared on the walls of the developers cubicles and 
was referenced regularly.
<P>
Secondly, the patterns created a common vocabulary in the 
development team. Developers described their applications in 
terms of the design patterns they had used to construct them. 
Listeners were able to understand the application structure very 
quickly since they were familiar with the design patterns from 
which it was constructed. There was much less time wasted in the 
fruitless discussion to understand trivially different custom design 
solutions.
<P>
Thirdly, most developers embraced the use of design patterns with 
enthusiasm. The project leader adopted a policy of requiring the 
use of existing design patterns when suitable, and this policy was 
enforced as part of the review process. There was little resistance 
to this policy of using existing, approved design patterns. Some 
people did resist, wanting to develop their own design structures 
for problems for which there was already a design pattern. These 
people either adapted to conforming to the policy, or left the team.

<H2>Mentoring</H2>
The project was assisted in the process described above by a 
consultant experienced in both Smalltalk and the use of design 
patterns. The consultant mentored the team in its learning of the 
language, and the application of design patterns. The availability 
of the mentor was a critical success factor for the project.
<P>
The initial team of Smalltalk neophytes was supplemented by 
more experienced Smalltalk developers. These also accelerated the 
learning process for the team.

<H2>Current State</H2>
The project was planned for three years, with incremental 
deliveries during that time. The project is still in progress. 

<H2>Lessons</H2>
Design patterns provide a bridge that allows developers to go 
beyond knowledge of a language to the construction of significant 
applications.
