<H2> Mark Weiser </H2>
<H3><I>``Software Engineering That Matters to People''</I></H3>

Dr. Mark Weiser is the Chief Technologist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC). Weiser has no bachelor's degree; his PhD is in Computer and
Communications Sciences from the University of Michigan (1979).  Weiser was
assistant and associate professor and associate chair in the Computer
Science Department at the University of Maryland from 1979 to 1987, when he
joined Xerox PARC as member of the technical staff, then heading the
Computer Science Laboratory for seven years.  He has started three
companies. His over 75 technical publications are on such areas as the
psychology of programming, program slicing, operating systems, programming
environments, garbage collection, and technological ethics. Weiser's work
since 1988 has been focused on Ubiquitous Computing, a program he initiated
that envisions PC's being replaced with invisible computers imbedded in
everyday objects. Weiser is the drummer with rock band Severe Tire Damage,
the first live band on the Internet.

<H2> Ed Yourdon </H2>
<H3><I>``Beyond Software Engineering: Ten Imperatives for the Successful 
Software Developer at the End of the Decade''</I></H3>

Edward Yourdon  methodologist, author, consultant, and
publisher of the American Programmer software journal. He is the
developer of the "Yourdon method" of structured systems analysis and
design implemented on most of today's CASE software engineering tools,
and is widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts in
software engineering. Ed Yourdon has worked in the computer industry
for nearly 30 years, and is the author of 20 textbooks and over 200
articles on software engineering. His most recent books include
Mainstream Objects (1995), Object-Oriented Systems Development (1994),
as well as Decline and Fall of the American Programmer, and two OO
books co-authored with Peter Coad. He is the Chairman of major
international conferences on CASE technology, is a Professor of
Information Technology at Universidad CAECE in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
and has received numerous honors and awards from other universities and
professional societies around the world.

<H2> Guy Steele </H2>
<H3><I>``Java and the Evolution of Web Software''</I></H3>

Guy L. Steele Jr. is a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems Laboratories 
in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and is responsible for research in programming 
languages, parallel algorithms, implementation strategies, and architectural 
and software support. He is currently working with James Gosling and Bill Joy 
on the detailed specification of the Java programming language. Steele has
published more than two dozen papers on the subject of the Lisp language 
and Lisp implementation, including a series with Gerald Jay Sussman that 
defined the Scheme dialect of Lisp. He is an ACM Fellow and a Fellow of 
the AAAI, and was awarded the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1988 as 
well as a Gordon Bell Prize in 1990. He designed the original EMACS command
set and was the first person to port TeX. Prior to joining Sun, he was a 
senior scientist at Thinking Machines Corporation, a member of technical 
staff at Tartan Laboratories, and an assistant professor at Carnegie-Mellon 
University. He is co-author of three books on programming languages: 
"Common Lisp: The Language," "C: A Reference Manual," and "The High 
Performance Fortran Handbook." 

<H4>ABSTRACT</H4>
The Java programming language has been enthusiastically adopted
for the production of software to be distributed through the
World Wide Web.  We discuss four ways in which Java has changed
or will change the way we produce software:
 
<UL>
<LI>  As a programming language, Java is safer and more robust than C
   and C++.  For example, it simply isn't possible to index off the end
   of an array (whether accidentally or on purpose).  Java is
   certainly not the first safe programming language, but it may
   be the means by which certain important improvements to the
   software infrastructure finally achieve widespread acceptance.
 
<LI>  The Java Language Specification addresses head-on the fact that
   programs may not be static, but grow over time, with different modules
   changing at different rates.  What can be said about code compatibility
   when a new version of a library module is released?
 
<LI>  Java and the Internet provide a new path for the distribution of
   software.  In particular, it becomes much easier to load software
   on demand.  This may make feasible new economic models for the software
   industry, such as renting software rather than buying it.  What are
   the advantages and pitfalls of such an approach?
 
<LI>  Java provides the opportunity for the development of the world's largest
   software system.  It will grow incrementally and haphazardly, just as the
   Wide Web, considered as a database, grew incrementally and haphazardly,
   driven by the purposes and dreams of thousands of people.  Will the
   result be useful?  Will it be stable?  What can we do to improve the
   outcome?
