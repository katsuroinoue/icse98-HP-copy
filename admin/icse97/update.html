<P>
Everyone associated with planning ICSE 97 has focused from the outset on expanding 
the community of attendees for the conference.  We have looked toward increased 
scope of topics and a broader range of attendees, while still preserving the traditional
technical program that has served the conference well over the years.  

<P>
As a co-founder of SIGSOFT and a veteran of ICSE conferences from the very beginning, 
I have seen ICSE conference attendance shift to be dominated by the academic and industrial
research communities, with much lower participation from practicing software engineers 
and their managers.  Those people often attend other technical conferences, such as
OOPSLA and CHI, or commercially-sponsored conferences, such as Software
Development or Object World.   As a result, there has been less interaction between
these communities, despite a substantial overlap in interests. 

<P>
We have also seen a major expansion in the scope of application development.  Software
engineering issues are relevant for graphical user interface development, for WWW-based
applications, and as part of rapid application development processes.  We felt that ICSE 97
should attempt to address those issues as part of the overall conference program, both
with traditional research submissions and with other conference activities.

<P>
In thinking about the ICSE 97 conference, we were strongly influenced by the CHI and 
OOPSLA conferences, large, successful conferences that bridge the research and
"practitioner" communities.  Above all, we wanted to make ICSE the "must attend"
conference for those interested in the state of the art of software engineering. 
Conferences succeed not only for the quality of their technical programs, for also
for the broader exchange of information at the conference.  The best conferences
fulfill a social role as well as a technical role, so that participants annually plan their 
budgets and schedules to include that conference.

What are we doing to make ICSE the "must attend" conference, and to increase its appeal
to the professional community?  Here are some of the steps we are taking:

<OL>
<LI>We are greatly expanding the number of invited speakers.  ICSE has always had
    invited Keynote Speakers, and that tradition will continue.  I am pleased to report
    that Ed Yourdon has accepted our invitation to be a Keynote Speaker.<BR>

<P>
    Beyond that, however, we are inviting speakers who will bring an industrial perspective
    to the conference.  These speakers will include well-known technologists and
    consultants, many of whom are regular speakers at commercially-sponsored conferences.
    Because they have designed or built innovative tools or applications,  they have made a
    significant contribution to software engineering.  At the same time, though, they
    are highly unlikely to prepare a research-oriented paper that would be
    accepted under the strict and highly selective criteria of the Technical Program
    Committee.  These invited presenters will be blended into the conference program.<BR>

<P>
    In this effort, I have been assisted by a Professional Program Committee, whose members
    have made valuable suggestions for topics and speakers.  Of course, I would also
    welcome additional suggestions from SEN readers.

<P>
<LI>We are expanding the number of tutorials and workshops.  Conferences such as CHI,
    OOPSLA, and SIGGRAPH have many tutorials.  A very large percentage of the conference
    attendees also register for at least one tutorial.  The tutorials are of high quality
    and are less expensive than those sponsored by commercial organizations.<BR>

<P>
    Workshops are like conferences within a conference, allow groups with specialized
    interests to meet and discuss their field.  Workshops are typically less formal,
    with participants submitting position papers rather than full papers that will
    compete with submissions to the ICSE 97 technical program.  By co-locating the
    workshops with the overall ICSE 97 conference, the workshop benefits from joint
    publicity, while the conference itself increases the size of the participant community.

<P>
<LI>We are planning a commercial tools exhibit, separate from research demonstrations.
    This exhibit will be organized by a professional conference management firm, 
    Danieli and O'Keefe, which is also responsible for registration and other conference
    logistics.  D&O'K have managed other similar conferences, including Tri-Ada and
    the ACM Multimedia conference.  They will be contacting hardware and software
    vendors this summer, trying to encourage them to exhibit at ICSE 97.  Since ICSE
    has not previously had such an exhibition, D&O'K will need assistance to put
    together an exhibition where many of the major vendors of software engineering
    products and services are represented.<BR>

<P>
    If you work for a vendor that could potentially be an exhibitor at ICSE 97, it would
    be very helpful if you could contact the person responsible for trade shows in your
    company and tell them about ICSE 97.  It would also be helpful if you could let me
    know the name and contact information for that person so that I can pass the
    information along to D&O'K. 

<P>
<LI>We are planning to introduce organization overviews.  If you would like to describe your     
    organization and one or more of its projects, you are strongly encouraged to submit a
    proposal. These overviews have been very popular at CHI and at other conferences.  They
    serve as a good way to disseminate information about your organization's activities,
    and also as an effective recruiting tool.
</OL>
<P>
Finally, we have selected an attractive venue.  The conference will be based at the 
Sheraton-Boston Hotel, in Boston's Prudential Center, near Back Bay with its 
restaurants and shops.   Boston is among the most interesting of American cities, 
with a broad range of sightseeing activities and lots of American history.  With the
conference immediately preceding the Memorial Day holiday weekend in the U.S.,
ICSE 97 provides a great opportunity to combine an outstanding technical conference
with a post-conference vacation.  The weather should be good, too. Just don't even
think about driving in Boston, though!  

Mark your calendars for the week of May 19, 1997, and put ICSE 97 in your 1997 budget.
