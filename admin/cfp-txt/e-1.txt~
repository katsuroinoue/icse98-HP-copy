ICSE's twentieth birthday affords an opportunity to reflect on
profound changes of the past two decades.

Since ICSE's founding, politics and technology have converged to
shatter once formidable barriers to international cooperation. The
collapse of the Berlin Wall symbolizes the end of the Cold War, and
links in a Web page are a metaphor for our enhanced capacity for
global information exchange.

In this spirit, we have worked hard to ensure that ICSE98 will see 
an unprecedented increase in the level of international participation 
and provide an opportunity to highlight the interests and accomplishments 
of members from the Asian-Pacific region. Yet our outreach must extend 
beyond geography. 
As we continue to build bridges to other software disciplines,
researchers and practitioners in allied fields will benefit from an
understanding of the contributions that software engineering can make
to their work. In turn, we must address their problems in our
research. New collaborations between academia and industry will also
enrich ICSE98 and our profession as a whole.

I hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to meet new
colleagues, exchange ideas, and explore the nearly limitless
possibilities that lie ahead. Join me in Kyoto for ICSE98 and share
the excitement that comes from forging new links.
