The annual International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) is 
the leading forum for the exchange of ideas on all aspects of software 
engineering. ICSE98 invites you to submit work to share with the ICSE 
community.
     
ICSE 98 encourages submissions from the many perspectives that 
contribute to the whole of Software Engineering. We particularly 
encourage papers addressing topics wherein software engineering issues 
play a key role, but where those topics have not been highlighted in 
previous ICSEs. We encourage discussions of both the process and 
outcome of research concerning design, engineering, development, 
installation, use, and maintenance.  
   Different classes of contributions are sought, ranging from research 
papers to lessons and status reports from software engineering 
organizations. The ultimate goal is to build a rich and comprehensive 
conference program that can fit the interests and needs of different 
classes of attendees: professionals, researchers, managers, and 
students.  
     
     
     
Submission Categories
     
Note: If you decide to submit, you should look into the ICSE98 Home 
Page (http://icse98.aist-nara.ac.jp/) to get the necessary information 
for the submission.

Panels:
     
The aim of the ICSE 98 panels is to stimulate discussion about ideas 
and issues of crucial importance to the software engineering 
community. Panel proposal should be sent via e-mail to both of the 
program co-chairs. The proposal should contain one-page description of 
the topic, one-page description of the panel format, and one-page 
summary of the organizer(s) and all the panelists.

Lessons and Status Reports:
     
The reports are intended to provide software engineering professionals 
with a picture of practices, procedures, techniques, products, and 
organizational structures. We encourage submissions from institutions, 
organizations, and groups within companies, universities, and 
government. Submissions may be from organizations of any size and any 
maturity level, ranging from small software development teams to larger 
teams of professional software developers working in large companies. 
Send two page report in the conference proceeding format (http:
