Preliminary Announcement and Call for Papers (ICSE-98)

The 20th International Conference on Software Engineering
April 19~25, 1998 
Kyoto International Conference Hall,
Kyoto, JAPAN

IEEE Computer Society,
ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering 

FORGING NEW LINKS!

ICSE's twentieth birthday affords an opportunity to reflect on
profound changes of the past two decades.
Since ICSE's founding, politics and technology have converged to
shatter once formidable barriers to international cooperation. The
collapse of the Berlin Wall symbolizes the end of the Cold War, and
links in a Web page are a metaphor for our enhanced capacity for
global information exchange.
In this spirit, we have worked hard to ensure that ICSE98 will see an
unprecedented increase in the level of international participation. In
particular, we will give a greater voice to members from the
Asian-Pacific region, an area under-represented in the past. Yet our
outreach must extend beyond geography.
As we continue to build bridges to other software disciplines,
researchers and practitioners in allied fields will benefit from an
understanding of the contributions that software engineering can make
to their work. In turn, we must address their problems in our
research. New collaborations between academia and industry will also
enrich ICSE98 and our profession as a whole.
The presentation of top-notch papers will, of course, constitute the
core activity of ICSE98. Cutting edge research will be showcased in
technical paper sessions, workshops, panels, posters, demonstrations,
and special sessions devoted to the lessons learned from building
large and complex software systems.
We hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to meet new
colleagues, exchange ideas, and explore the nearly limitless
possibilities that lie ahead. Join us in Kyoto for ICSE98 and share
the excitement that comes from forging new links.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL PAPERS

AIM 
Papers describe innovative and significant work in the research and
practice of Software Engineering. Papers are collected in an archival,
refereed conference proceedings, published by IEEE/ACM, which is cited
and read by researchers and practitioners world-wide. Accepted papers
are presented at the ICSE conference, attended by hundreds of
people. Having a paper on the technical program gives authors an
opportunity to have a tremendous impact on the study and application
of Software Engineering principles, theory, and techniques.

SCOPE 
The Software Engineering community consists of researchers and
professionals from many different disciplines and intellectual
traditions. The paper review process tries to rigorously review all
submissions in a manner that takes into account the different criteria
from different parts of the community. For reviewers to do this
effectively, they need an accurate assessment of the type of each
paper they read; that is, research contributions or experience papers. 
Please select the type of paper that best describes your submission
and write it in the appropriate place on the Cover Page (see the home
page). If you feel that your submission does not fit any of these
types, please contact either program co-chair for help in best
classifying your submission.

REVIEW PROCESS 
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by a group of at least three
members of the program committee. Reviewer assignment will be done by
matching the topic and focus of the paper with committee member
expertise. The committee members will develop a summary review and
recommendation for acceptance or rejection. Final decisions will be
made at a program committee meeting, where the committee as a whole
will review the recommendations and rationale made by committee
members.

Note that in addition to considering the criteria outlined for each
type of paper (see the ICSE98 Home Page), all papers will be evaluated
for overall quality of presentation: the problem and its context must
be clearly described, including relation to prior work. It must also
be clear from the presentation that a succinct, high quality verbal
presentation at the conference will be possible.

HOW TO SUBMIT 
If you decide to submit, you should look into the ICSE98 Home Page to
get the necessary information for the submission! In particular, note
that the deadline for requesting ICSE98 mentoring is 10 weeks before
the deadline of the paper submission.

The following lists the steps you should follow for submitting a paper. 

1.Electronic Submission of Title and Abstract (Required): 
In addition to their appearance in the full, printed paper, the title
and abstract of every submission must also be transmitted by email to
icse-98-papers@cs.ucsb.edu by the deadline for abstracts shown
above. The abstract must be plain text only (ASCII) - no markup
languages, no binhex, no binary files. 

2.Submission of Full Papers:
Submitted papers must conform to the standard Conference Proceedings
format (See http://icse98.aist-nara.ac.jp/how-to-submit.html). Papers
may be no longer than 10 pages in the Conference Proceedings format,
including references, appendices and figures. The full papers may not
be submitted electronically; six paper copies are required.

UPON ACCEPTANCE 
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
November 1997. Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 98
Conference Proceedings. The primary author of each accepted paper will
receive an Author Kit with detailed instructions on how to submit the
camera-ready copy.

PANELS

AIM 
The aim of the ICSE 98 panels is to stimulate discussion about ideas
and issues of crucial importance to the software engineering
community. Panels may emphasize complex technical issues, but they may
equally provide an opportunity to propose views and address
controversies through the medium of informed debate. Suitable topics
for such discussion include pressing issues in software engineering
theory and practice, emerging industry trends and enabling
technologies, and professional, organizational, and social issues
associated with software engineering. Panels last about 90 minutes and
can be organized in many formats. We strongly encourage proposals in
original formats that will engage the panelists and audience in a
lively and substantive discussion.

Panels may address any topic of relevance to software engineering
research and practice. Panels are an opportunity to stimulate thinking
about how software engineering is evolving. This means that topics
need not be limited to the conventional boundaries of the field.

REVIEW PROCESS 
Each proposal will be reviewed by the program co-chairs. We are
looking for stimulating and timely proposals that will be debated by
well-informed and engaging panelists and that will form a diverse,
controversial, and well thought out collection. Please feel free to
contact either program co-chair in advance to discuss your proposal.

HOW TO SUBMIT 
If you decide to submit, you should look into the ICSE98 Home Page to
get the necessary information for the submission! Panel proposal
should be sent via e-mail to both of the program co-chairs. The
proposal should contain the following:
* A one-page description of the topic, stating compelling issues to be
debated, and their relevance to software engineering.
* One-page description of the panel format (not limited to those
specified above), stating how the panel will be conducted and why the
proposed format is suitable for the given topic.
* One page summary of the organizer(s) and all the panelists, including
names, affiliations, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. Panelists
must have agreed to be members of the panel.

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the end of
November 1997.

LESSONS AND STATUS REPORTS 

AIM 
Lessons and Status Reports were introduced to the ICSE program at
ICSE97. The reports are intended to provide software engineering
professionals with a picture of practices, procedures, techniques,
products, and organizational structures. Our goal is to provide
software engineers and managers with:
* insights that can be adapted and applied within their own work
practices and organizations; 
* information on the activities of
software engineering practitioners doing innovative and potentially
influential work;
* information on software engineering activities
which form the basis for future generations of software engineering
tools, techniques and management.

SCOPE 
We encourage submissions from institutions, organizations, and groups
within companies, universities, and government. Submissions may be
from organizations of any size and any maturity level, ranging from
small software development teams to larger teams of professional
software developers working in large companies. We also encourage
submissions

describing a broad range of applications, from single-user PC software
to global, enterprise-wide solutions.

Reports may describe software engineering activities in; 

* Software planning, acquisition, and integration organizations,
* Software development and maintenance organizations, 
* Software engineering process groups or consultatory organizations,
* Quality assurance groups or independent products evaluators,
* Collaborative efforts involving several groups or organizations,
* Partnerships of different types of groups, or 
* Groups cooperating across geographical, political, or cultural boundaries.

We are looking for lessons, procedures, techniques and products,
including new perspectives on old but as yet unsolved problems, that
stimulate practicing software engineers, R&D organizations, and
software engineering researchers, and that can be learned and applied.

Examples of topics may include but are not limited to: 

* Assessment and transfer of new technologies, including education,
training and supporting issues. 
* Planning and implementation of a new methodology into an
organization.  
* Experience in the application of CASE Tools.
* Practice of process design, process assessment and process
improvement.
* Application of software quality metrics and evaluation practice.
* Experience on some aspects of the application of innovative software
engineering techniques in organizations.

The submissions should emphasize; 
the circumstances under which work is done; the underlying goals,
policies, and organizational background; perspectives of past,
present, and future software engineering efforts.

We aim to bring together people to report about their practice with
the focus on giving the "big picture" rather than a technically
interesting focus on a single scientific result.

REVIEW PROCESS 

Submissions will be reviewed for acceptance based on: the interest to
members of the software engineering community; the significance of
impact of the report to the Software Engineering community; and the
objective of informing the software engineering community activities
world wide.

Submissions are solicited from organizations. Solicited proposals will
be subject to the same review process and criteria as proposals
submitted in response to this call.

HOW TO SUBMIT 
Proposed Lessons and Status Reports must be prepared in the Conference
Proceedings Format (see http: //icse98.aist-nara.ac.jp/). Proposals
must not exceed 2 pages in length.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. The
primary author of each accepted report will receive an Author Kit with
detailed instructions on how to submit camera-ready materials for
publication.

At the conference, the Status Report should be presented by a major
participant in the work. The presentation should be based on the
material described in the Status Report Summary.

POSTERS AND RESEARCH DEMONSTRATIONS

AIM 
Posters and Research Demonstrations provide an excellent opportunity
to show late-breaking results and to discuss the results with the
conference participants. Interactive communication and demonstration
will be the most exciting and powerful presentation.

SCOPE 

Posters 
All types of work in software engineering can be presented effectively
using posters during the conference. Display space will be provided in
the poster and research demonstration room. A description of each
poster will appear in the proceedings for posters and research
demonstrations. 

Research Demonstrations
Research demonstrations are intended to show early implementation of
novel software engineering concepts. Research demonstrations will be
scheduled into blocks of time for demonstration. In addition, a booth
will be provided in the poster and research demonstration room to
allow informal demonstrations throughout the conference. A description
of each research demonstration will appear in the proceedings for
research demonstrations. We consider any system which is at least six
months away from appearing in a commercial product as a "research
system". Commercial systems will not be accepted as research
demonstrations.

REVIEW PROCESS 
Submissions will be reviewed by the committee using the standard ICSE
criteria : originality, importance and generality of contribution,
soundness of rationale or demonstration, quality of written and
graphic presentation and appropriate citation of relevant literature.

COMPUTING AND PROJECTION EQUIPMENT 
The conference will not provide any electronic equipment such as CPUs,
disk drives, displays or videotapes for demonstration or presentation.

DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM

AIM 
ICSE'98 will host a forum for graduate students to present and discuss
their dissertation research objectives, approaches and preliminary
results. Doctoral students, who are within approximately one year of
thesis completion, are invited to apply to the Doctoral Symposium, a
closed session in which a group of students present their research and
get useful guidance and comments from established researchers and
other doctoral students. The one-day symposium aims to broaden the
perspectives of new entrants to the software engineering research
community and to provide constructive comments on the ongoing thesis
research.

As the systems of doctoral courses are different by cultures, we are
expecting participants coming from America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and
all over the world. We plan to invite people from typical academic
cultures to explain their doctoral systems so that we can compare and
discuss differences between countries.

HOW TO APPLY 
We are looking for students who are advanced enough to have a specific
research proposal and some preliminary results, but with sufficient
time remaining to thesis completion to benefit from the symposium
experience. Application forms for describing the thesis topic and
progress are available from the Symposium chair. A letter of
recommendation from the student's thesis advisor is also required. The
applications are reviewed by the committee, and acceptance and
rejection will be notified. Students selected as participants will
receive partial reimbursement for conference-related expenses.

half or two days in length. Workshops are not alternative forums for
full papers which otherwise could be submitted to ICSE. Participation
in workshops is typically dependent on submission of position
statements.

REVIEW PROCESS 
Workshop proposals will be reviewed by a committee representing a
cross-section of software engineering researchers and
professionals. Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the
workshop's potential for generating useful results, the timeliness and
expected interest level in the topic, and organizer's ability to lead
a successful workshop.

HOW TO SUBMIT 
Prepare a three-page proposal for the workshop review
committee. Workshop proposal should contain:
* an outline of the theme and goals of the workshop and its
relevance to the field;
* a description of the desired number of participants, the participant
solicitation and selection process, pre-workshop activities, and

similar event in Kyoto. And it will also be possible to implement
other plans such as to have a forum to discuss emerging Asian software
markets, or for special exhibits of software engineering tools made in
Asia.

WELCOME TO KYOTO IN CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON

CITY OF HISTORY AND LEARNING 
Kyoto, a city with 1,200 years of history, is the cultural soul of
Japan. Nestled among low mountains, it is blessed with both natural
beauty and a rich historical legacy. It is the ideal site for
international conventions. From its establishment as Japan's capital
in 794 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Kyoto flourished as the
center of government, commerce and culture in Japan. Traditional arts
and an abundance of shrines and temples give the city its distinct
character. With nearly 1.5 million residents, Kyoto is a vibrant
mixture of old and new. Many high-tech firms have chosen it as their
headquarters, and the city boasts 47 public and private colleges and
universities. These significant intellectual resources combine with
Kyoto's long history and tradition to provide an ideal milieu for
innovation and creativity.

NATURAL BEAUTY 
Kyoto is a panorama of the changing seasons: from the springtime
cherry blossoms lining narrow walkways, the lush greenery of summer,
to the brilliant autumn foliage of Japanese maples and the delicate
layer of snow covering the surrounding mountainsides in winter. The
passage of seasons is also evident in the beautiful gardens of Kyoto's
ancient temples and shrines.

CULTURAL HERITAGE 
Reflecting its long history as the cultural and religious center of
Japan, Kyoto is home to nearly 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto
shrines. The city's international cultural significance was recognized
when 17 historical sites in Kyoto were designated as UNESCO World
Cultural Heritage Sites. Kyoto is the location of 20% of Japan's
national treasures. More than 60 museums throughout the city offer
visitors the opportunity to view priceless works of art and important
cultural objects.

KYOTO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HALL 
Japan's leading convention center, the Kyoto International Conference
Hall, is a complex consisting of seven separate conference halls, the
largest of which can hold 2,000 persons. Another 70 conference rooms
of various sizes are available for smaller meetings. Two large banquet
halls and a Japanese landscape garden offer additional settings for
convention participants to meet and communicate informally.

TRANSPORT 
Kyoto has many modern hotels with accommodations for up to 20,000
visitors. Located near the center of Japan, it is readily accessible
by land and air. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet train) links Tokyo
with Kyoto in 2 hours and 15 minutes. Overseas visitors arriving at
Kansai International Airport have a comfortable 75-minute ride by the
Haruka Express train to Kyoto Station. Kyoto has a well-developed
public transportation system of trains, subways and buses. Extensions
to the Kyoto subway system will provide a direct link from Kyoto
Station to the Kyoto International Conference Hall by the end of July '97.
