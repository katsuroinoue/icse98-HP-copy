<P>
ICSE's twentieth birthday affords an opportunity to reflect on
profound changes of the past two decades. <BR>
<P>
Since ICSE's founding, politics and technology have converged
to shatter once formidable barriers to international cooperation.
The collapse of the Berlin Wall symbolizes the end of the Cold
War, and links in a Web page are a metaphor for our enhanced capacity
for global information exchange. <BR>
<P>
In this spirit, we have worked hard to ensure that ICSE98 will
see an unprecedented increase in the level of international participation.
In particular, we will give a greater voice to members from the
Asian-Pacific region, an area under-represented in the past. Yet
our outreach must extend beyond geography. <BR>
<P>
As we continue to build bridges to other software disciplines,
researchers and practitioners in allied fields will benefit from
an understanding of the contributions that software engineering
can make to their work. In turn, we must address their problems
in our research. New collaborations between academia and industry
will also enrich ICSE98 and our profession as a whole. <BR>
<P>
The presentation of top-notch papers will, of course, constitute
the core activity of ICSE98. Cutting edge research will be showcased
in technical paper sessions, workshops, panels, posters, demonstrations,
and special sessions devoted to the lessons learned from building
large and complex software systems. <BR>
<P>
I hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to meet
new colleagues, exchange ideas, and explore the nearly limitless
possibilities that lie ahead. Join me in Kyoto for ICSE98 and
share the excitement that comes from forging new links.<BR>

<CENTER>DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>AIM</FONT>
<P>
ICSE'98 will host a forum for graduate students to present and
discuss their dissertation research objectives, approaches and
preliminary results. Doctoral students, who are within approximately
one year of thesis completion, are invited to apply to the Doctoral
Symposium, a closed session in which a group of students present
their research and get useful guidance and comments from established
researchers and other doctoral students. The one-day symposium
aims to broaden the perspectives of new entrants to the software
engineering research community and to provide constructive comments
on the ongoing thesis research. <BR>
<P>
As the systems of doctoral courses are different by cultures,
we are expecting participants coming from America, Europe, Asia-Pacific
and all over the world. We plan to invite people from typical
academic cultures to explain their doctoral systems so that we
can compare and discuss differences between countries.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>HOW TO APPLY</FONT>
<P>
We are looking for students who are advanced enough to have a
specific research proposal and some preliminary results, but with
sufficient time remaining to thesis completion to benefit from
the symposium experience. Application forms for describing the
thesis topic and progress are available from the Symposium chair.
A letter of recommendation from the student's thesis advisor is
also required. The applications are reviewed by the committee,
and acceptance and rejection will be notified. Students selected
as participants will receive partial reimbursement for conference-related
expenses.<BR>

<CENTER>PANELS</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>AIM</FONT>
<P>
The aim of the ICSE 98 panels is to stimulate discussion about
ideas and issues of crucial importance to the software engineering
community. Panels may emphasize complex technical issues, but
they may equally provide an opportunity to propose views and address
controversies through the medium of informed debate. Suitable
topics for such discussion include pressing issues in software
engineering theory and practice, emerging industry trends and
enabling technologies, and professional, organizational, and social
issues associated with software engineering. Panels last about
90 minutes and can be organized in many formats. We strongly encourage
proposals in original formats that will engage the panelists and
audience in a lively and substantive discussion. <BR>
<P>
Panels may address any topic of relevance to software engineering
research and practice. Panels are an opportunity to stimulate
thinking about how software engineering is evolving. This means
that topics need not be limited to the conventional boundaries
of the field.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>REVIEW PROCESS</FONT>
<P>
Each proposal will be reviewed by the program co-chairs. We are
looking for stimulating and timely proposals that will be debated
by well-informed and engaging panelists and that will form a diverse,
controversial, and well thought out collection. Please feel free
to contact either program co-chair in advance to discuss your
proposal.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>HOW TO SUBMIT</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>AIM</FONT>
<P>
Papers describe innovative and significant work in the research
and practice of Software Engineering. Papers are collected in
an archival, refereed conference proceedings, published by IEEE/ACM,
which is cited and read by researchers and practitioners world-wide.
Accepted papers are presented at the ICSE conference, attended
by hundreds of people. Having a paper on the technical program
gives authors an opportunity to have a tremendous impact on the
study and application of Software Engineering principles, theory,
and techniques.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>SCOPE</FONT>
<P>
The Software Engineering community consists of researchers and
professionals from many different disciplines and intellectual
traditions. The paper review process tries to rigorously review
all submissions in a manner that takes into account the different
criteria from different parts of the community. For reviewers
to do this effectively, they need an accurate assessment of the
type of each paper they read; that is, research contributions
or experience papers. Please select the type of paper that best
describes your submission and write it in the appropriate place
on the Cover Page (see the home page). If you feel that your submission
does not fit any of these types, please contact either program
co-chair for help in best classifying your submission.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>REVIEW PROCESS</FONT>
<P>
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by a group of at least three
members of the program committee. Reviewer assignment will be
done by matching the topic and focus of the paper with committee
member expertise. The committee members will develop a summary
review and recommendation for acceptance or rejection. Final decisions
will be made at a program committee meeting, where the committee
as a whole will review the recommendations and rationale made
by committee members.<BR>
<P>
Note that in addition to considering the criteria outlined for
each type of paper (see the ICSE98 Home Page), all papers will
be evaluated for overall quality of presentation: the problem
and its context must be clearly described, including relation
to prior work. It must also be clear from the presentation that
a succinct, high quality verbal presentation at the conference
will be possible.<BR>

<CENTER>WELCOME TO KYOTO IN CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CITY OF HISTORY AND LEARNING</FONT>
<P>
Kyoto, a city with 1,200 years of history, is the cultural soul
of Japan. Nestled among low mountains, it is blessed with both
natural beauty and a rich historical legacy. It is the ideal site
for international conventions. From its establishment as Japan's
capital in 794 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Kyoto flourished
as the center of government, commerce and culture in Japan. Traditional
arts and an abundance of shrines and temples give the city its
distinct character. With nearly 1.5 million residents, Kyoto is
a vibrant mixture of old and new. Many high-tech firms have chosen
it as their headquarters, and the city boasts 47 public and private
colleges and universities. These significant intellectual resources
combine with Kyoto's long history and tradition to provide an
ideal milieu for innovation and creativity.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NATURAL BEAUTY</FONT>
<P>
Kyoto is a panorama of the changing seasons: from the springtime
cherry blossoms lining narrow walkways, the lush greenery of summer,
to the brilliant autumn foliage of Japanese maples and the delicate
layer of snow covering the surrounding mountainsides in winter.
The passage of seasons is also evident in the beautiful gardens
of Kyoto's ancient temples and shrines. <BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CULTURAL HERITAGE</FONT>
<P>
Reflecting its long history as the cultural and religious center
of Japan, Kyoto is home to nearly 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto
shrines. The city's international cultural significance was recognized
when 17 historical sites in Kyoto were designated as UNESCO World
Cultural Heritage Sites. Kyoto is the location of 20% of Japan's
national treasures. More than 60 museums throughout the city offer
visitors the opportunity to view priceless works of art and important
cultural objects. <BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>KYOTO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HALL</FONT>
<P>
Japan's leading convention center, the Kyoto International Conference
Hall, is a complex consisting of seven separate conference halls,
the largest of which can hold 2,000 persons. Another 70 conference
rooms of various sizes are available for smaller meetings. Two
large banquet halls and a Japanese landscape garden offer additional
settings for convention participants to meet and communicate informally.
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>TRANSPORT</FONT>
<P>
Kyoto has many modern hotels with accommodations for up to 20,000
visitors. Located near the center of Japan, it is readily accessible
by land and air. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet train) links
Tokyo with Kyoto in 2 hours and 15 minutes. Overseas visitors
arriving at Kansai International Airport have a comfortable 75-minute
ride by the Haruka Express train to Kyoto Station. Kyoto has a
well-developed public transportation system of trains, subways
and buses. Extensions to the Kyoto subway system will provide
a direct link from Kyoto Station to the Kyoto International Conference
Hall by the end of July '97. <BR>
