<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">ICSE's twentieth birthday affords an
opportunity to reflect on profound changes of the past two decades.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">Since ICSE's founding, politics and
technology have converged to shatter once formidable barriers
to international cooperation. The collapse of the Berlin Wall
symbolizes the end of the Cold War, and links in a Web page are
a metaphor for our enhanced capacity for global information exchange.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">In this spirit, we have worked hard
to ensure that ICSE98 will see an unprecedented increase in the
level of international participation. In particular, we will give
a greater voice to members from the Asian-Pacific region, an area
under-represented in the past. Yet our outreach must extend beyond
geography. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">As we continue to build bridges to other
software disciplines, researchers and practitioners in allied
fields will benefit from an understanding of the contributions
that software engineering can make to their work.  In turn, we
must address their problems in our research. New collaborations
between academia and industry will also enrich ICSE98 and our
profession as a whole.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">The presentation of top-notch papers
will, of course, constitute the core activity of ICSE98.  Cutting
edge research will be showcased in technical paper sessions, workshops,
panels, posters, demonstrations, and special sessions devoted
to the lessons learned from building large and complex software
systems. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">I hope you will take advantage of this
unique opportunity to meet new colleagues, exchange ideas, and
explore the nearly limitless possibilities that lie ahead. Join
me in Kyoto for ICSE98 and share the excitement that comes from
forging new links.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">AIM</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Papers describe innovative and significant
work in the research and practice of Software Engineering. Papers
are collected in an archival, refereed conference proceedings,
published by IEEE/ACM, which is cited and read by researchers
and practitioners world-wide. Accepted papers are presented at
the ICSE conference, attended by hundreds of people. Having a
paper on the technical program gives authors an opportunity to
have a tremendous impact on the study and application of Software
Engineering principles, theory, and techniques.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">SCOPE</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The Software Engineering community consists
of researchers and professionals from many different disciplines
and intellectual traditions. The paper review process tries to
rigorously review all submissions in a manner that takes into
account the different criteria from different parts of the community.
For reviewers to do this effectively, they need an accurate assessment
of the type of each paper they read; that is, research contributions
or experience papers. Please select the type of paper that best
describes your submission and write it in</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">the appropriate place on the Cover Page (see
the home page). If you feel that your submission does not fit
any of these types, please contact either program co-chair for
help in best classifying your submission.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">REVIEW PROCESS</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Each submitted paper will be reviewed by a
group of at least three members of the program committee. Reviewer
assignment will be done by matching the topic and focus of the
paper with committee member expertise. The committee members will
develop a summary review and recommendation for acceptance or
rejection. Final decisions will be made at a program committee
meeting, where the committee as a whole will review the recommendations
and rationale made by committee members.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Note that in addition to considering the criteria
outlined for each type of paper (see the ICSE98 Home Page), all
papers will be evaluated for overall quality of presentation:
the problem and its context must be clearly described, including
relation to prior work. It must also be clear from the presentation
that a succinct, high quality verbal presentation at the conference
will be possible.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">HOW TO SUBMIT</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">If you decide to submit, you should look into
the ICSE98 Home Page to get the necessary information for the

<FONT FACE="Times">The aim of the ICSE 98 panels is to stimulate
discussion about ideas and issues of crucial importance to the
software engineering community. Panels may emphasize complex technical
issues, but they may equally provide an opportunity to propose
views and address controversies through the medium of informed
debate. Suitable topics for such discussion include pressing issues
in software engineering theory and practice, emerging industry
trends and enabling technologies, and professional, organizational,
and social issues associated with software engineering. Panels
last about 90 minutes and can be organized in many formats. We
strongly encourage proposals in original formats that will engage
the panelists and audience in a lively and substantive discussion.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Panels may address any topic of relevance to
software engineering research and practice. Panels are an opportunity
to stimulate thinking about how software engineering is evolving.
This means that topics need not be limited to the conventional
boundaries of the field.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">ICSE'98 will host a forum for graduate students
to present and discuss their dissertation research objectives,
approaches and preliminary results. Doctoral students, who are
within approximately one year of thesis completion, are invited
to apply to the Doctoral Symposium, a closed session in which
a group of students present their research and get useful guidance
and comments from established researchers and other doctoral students.
 The one-day symposium aims to broaden the perspectives of new
entrants to the software engineering research community and to
provide constructive comments on the ongoing thesis research.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">As the systems of doctoral courses are different
by cultures, we are expecting participants coming from America,
Europe, Asia-Pacific and all over the world. We plan to invite
people from typical academic cultures to explain their doctoral
systems so that we can compare and discuss differences between
countries.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">HOW TO APPLY</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">We are looking for students who are advanced
enough to have a specific research proposal and some preliminary
results, but with sufficient time remaining to thesis completion
to benefit from the symposium experience. Application forms for
describing the thesis topic and progress are available from the
Symposium chair. A letter of recommendation from the student's
thesis advisor is also required. Students selected as participants
will receive partial reimbursement for conference-related expenses.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kyoto, a city with 1,200 years of history,
is the cultural soul of Japan. Nestled among low mountains, it
is blessed with both natural beauty and a rich historical legacy.
It is the ideal site for international conventions. From its establishment
as Japan's capital in 794 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868,
Kyoto flourished as the center of government, commerce and culture
in Japan. Traditional arts and an abundance of shrines and temples
give the city its distinct character.  With nearly 1.5 million
residents, Kyoto is a vibrant mixture of old and new. Many high-tech
firms have chosen it as their headquarters, and the city boasts
47 public and private colleges and universities. These significant
intellectual resources combine with Kyoto's long history and tradition
to provide an ideal milieu for innovation and creativity.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">NATURAL BEAUTY</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kyoto is a panorama of the changing seasons:
from the springtime cherry blossoms lining narrow walkways, the
lush greenery of summer, to the brilliant autumn foliage of Japanese
maples and the delicate layer of snow covering the surrounding
mountainsides in winter. The passage of seasons is also evident
in the beautiful gardens of Kyoto's ancient temples and shrines.

<FONT FACE="Times">Reflecting its long history as the cultural
and religious center of Japan, Kyoto is home to nearly 2,000 Buddhist
temples and Shinto shrines. The city's international cultural
significance was recognized when 17 historical sites in Kyoto
were designated as UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites. Kyoto
is the location of 20% of Japan's national treasures. More than
60 museums throughout the city offer visitors the opportunity
to view priceless works of art and important cultural objects.
